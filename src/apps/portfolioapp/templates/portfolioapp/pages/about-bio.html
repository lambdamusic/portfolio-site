        I'm a <a href="https://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2010/07/26/knowledge-representation-workshop-cch/index.html">knowledge engineer</a> at heart and have been dealing with the problem of eliciting, representing, organising and exploring knowledge via digital means for 20+ years and manyfold technologies. 
        
        <br /><br />
        I currently work at <a href="https://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a>, an organization whose mission is to help researchers and the broader scientific world do things faster - and better - thanks to innovative software products. My focus and expertise is <a href="https://www.dimensions.ai/">Dimensions</a>. Dimensions has been descibed as the worldâ€™s largest linked research information dataset. It is a business intelligence platform used by  organizations in order to discover, evaluate, assess and gather competitive intelligence about research-related topics across the disciplines.

        <br /><br />
        Prior to that, I worked at <a href="https://www.springernature.com/">Springer Nature</a> as an information & data architect and developed projects such as <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/scigraph">SN Scigraph</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects">Nature.com subject pages</a> and the underlying Nature Ontologies portal.

        <br /><br />
        I hold a PhD in semantic web technologies from the <a href="https://kmi.open.ac.uk/">Knowledge Media Institute</a> (The Open University, UK) and advanced degrees in logic and philosophy of language from the <a href="https://www.unive.it/">University of Venice</a> (Italy). After my doctorate, I spent various years as a research associate at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh">King's College Department of Digital Humanities</a> (London), where I worked on influential digital humanities projects such as the <a href="https://www.poms.ac.uk/">People of Medieval Scotland</a> and the <a href="http://www.artofmaking.ac.uk/">Art of Making in Antiquity</a>.
