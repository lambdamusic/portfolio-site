        Hello and welcome to my personal site.
        <br /><br />
        I’m Michele. Was born in Italy, live in the UK, I'm a father of two, have a computer science <a href="/papers/2009/07/30/ontological-requirement-for-supporting-smart-navigation-of-philosophical-resources/">PhD</a> and enjoy writing. Code, music, words. Both for fun and to make a living. 
        <br /><br />
        I specialised in a sub-field of artificial intelligence called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_engineering">ontology engineering</a>, but over the years have worked on a variety of related areas including information architecture, data architecture, data analytics and data visualization. The concept of <i>design for content exploration</i> is the key underlying thread for me: how can we best structure digital information spaces so to make it easier for end-users to find stuff?
        <br /><br />
        On this website you’ll find a bit of everything.  Open source <a href="https://www.michelepasin.org/projects/index.html%3Fk=open-source.html">software</a>, academic <a href="/words">papers</a> and half-baked <a href="/sounds">musical</a> compositions. What you might not find is a coherent explanation of how it all fits together, I am afraid. Still, I hope you'll discover something that sparks your imagination and creativity. 
        <br /><br />
        That's it, my friend. Do leave a <a href="/contact">message</a> if you feel like it. Or, if you want a more impersonal and pompous bio, keep reading then.
