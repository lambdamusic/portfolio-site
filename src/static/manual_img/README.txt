PROJECTS IMAGES 

Note: this folder is managed manually, then images are loaded at runtime into a project page

* a project folder should match the project urlstub (see in admin)

* if an image is named '{{ p.urlstub }}.png' it gets selected as the main-image for the project

* hence in order to maintain ordering, secondary images have a number suffix eg resquotes2, resquotes3, etc..

* PS: images have been processed via PICASA (before being imported there)


ONTOLOGY AND OTHER IMAGES

These are managed manually within folders with predefined names 
eg `ontologies`, `livecoding` etc..
