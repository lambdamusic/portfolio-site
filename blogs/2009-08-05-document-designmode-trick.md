Here's a neat trick I got from my friend Geoffroy: open up your preferred Javascript console and type in this command:

> ```
> 
> document.designMode='on'
> 
> ```

  
Et voila': your page is directly editable in your browser! Useful for quick visual testing/modifications when giving a demo, for example....
