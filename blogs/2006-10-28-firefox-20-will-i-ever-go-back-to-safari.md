Unfortunately, this is the truth - it looks and performs greatly. It's [Firefox 2](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ "download for mac"). I just installed it, (yes it's a "boring" saturday afternoon, just me and my mac) and found out some new and old features... I was particularly missing the possibility of having dropdown folders on the bookmark bar (like in Safari), and now we've got that!! But there's [many other features](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/ "list of features") taken from other cool browsers like the Oslo based [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)..

I also never used that much the [search engines](https://addons.mozilla.org/search-engines.php "search engines page"), which are so cool!!

Lots and lots of old and new [plugins and addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/ "too many to choose from..")!!

I'm particularly amazed by the [Coliris extension](http://cooliris.com/ "go get it"): indeed a revolution in the browsing experience:

> Cooliris is a set of free browser extensions that gives you the power to quickly preview the underlying content of links without clicking. Simply rest your mouse over a link and see the content immediately. No more clicking back and forth! Cooliris lets you browse the web faster. Pre-fetches your links so you can preview it without clicking.Reduces Back button clicks and dead link visits.

In the image below I'm reading a blog, using the ctrl+mouseOver feature on the comments link, and et-voila a pop up comes out with the link-contents. You can also select stuff on it. If u don't like, just move the mouse away, click something else and it'll disappear. Cool!!!!!

These guys have also produced another yammy product: [PicLens](http://piclens.com/mac/). It's an extension for viewing images on a web page in full screen, like with your preferred slideshow-software!!!! For now, it only works on safari :-) In the image below, I'm browsing my pictures collection on Flickr.

I've decided, Safari for image-purposed and free-time browsing, firefox for all the rest...
