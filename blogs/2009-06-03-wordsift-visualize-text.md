WordSift \[[http://www.wordsift.com/](http://www.wordsift.com/)\] is a tool that was created primarily for **teachers**. Mainly, think of it playfully - as a toy in a linguistic playground that is available to instantly **capture and display the vocabulary structure of texts**, and to help **create an opportunity to talk and play with language.

ThisÂ web2 application can be pretty useful... super-simple to use and effective!

> WordSift helps anyone easily sift through texts -- just cut and paste any text into WordSift and you can engage in a verbal quick-capture! The program helps to quickly identify important words that appear in the text. This function is widely available in various **Tag Cloud** programs on the web, but we integrate it here with a few other functions, such as **visualization of word relationships** and G**oogle searches of images and videos**. With just a click on any word in the Tag Cloud, the program displays instances of sentences in which that word is used in the text.
