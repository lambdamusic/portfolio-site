Here's a simple AppleScript that makes it easier to extract presenter notes from a Keynote presentation and save them to a nice Markdown document.

If you're using [Apple Keynote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)), you may have noticed that there isn't an easy way to extract the presenter notes attached to your slides (of course you could do it manually, one slide at a time, but that's pretty tedious!).

The following [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript) code allows you to automate this action by pulling out all presenter notes from an open presentation and save them to a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file.
