An offline copy of the django docs can be quite helpful if you find yourself doing development work without an internet connection. Obviously, django comes with its docs that you can generate (provided [you have Sphinx and build tools](http://www.harshj.com/2008/12/19/getting-the-latest-django-documentation-to-run-offline/)). However sometimes a pdf is the handiest solution... here're some useful links I found: **Docs in CHM and PDF formats**: [http://charupload.wordpress.com/2007/12/02/django-documentation-chm/](http://charupload.wordpress.com/2007/12/02/django-documentation-chm/)

Docs as a **django application**: [http://smileychris.tactful.co.nz/ramblings/django-documentation/](http://smileychris.tactful.co.nz/ramblings/django-documentation/) (see the screenshot below)
