Ever wondered how many musical albums focus on topics like the [moon landing](http://www.nature.com/developers/hacks/spotisci/?q=moon+landing), [artificial intelligence](http://www.nature.com/developers/hacks/spotisci/?q=artificial+intelligence) or [DNA replication](http://www.nature.com/developers/hacks/spotisci/?q=DNA+replication)? Probably not for everyone's taste, but if you give it a shot you'll be surprised at the results.

When I ran into the excellent Spotipy [library](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) (a small yet nifty Python client for the Spotify [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)) I couldn't wait to try it out with some fun project.

So that's how the [SpotiSci experiment](http://www.nature.com/developers/hacks/spotisci/) came about; essentially a search tool that allows to query [Nature.com](http://www.nature.com/search)'s one million articles archives while at the same time browsing the vast selection of music available on [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/).

Have a good listen. You may find the right soundtrack for your science.
