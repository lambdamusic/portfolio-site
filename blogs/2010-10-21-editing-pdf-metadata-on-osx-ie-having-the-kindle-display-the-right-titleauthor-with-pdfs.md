One of the cool things you get to do with a Kindle is being able to access your pdf library on the go; however soon enough I ran into the problem of getting all the pdf files to show up with the right metadata, e.g. name, author, creator etc..

I thought that was a simple thing to do; nope! Spent quite some time looking for the right piece of software. Here's my experience:

### 1\. The False Friends

[Adobe Reader](http://get.adobe.com/reader/). It does say only 'reader' but since you can see the metadata so easily, I thought Adobe would have let us edit them too. No way..

[Itunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). I didn't know that, but yes it does open and catalogue your pdf files too. And it makes you think that you can edit some sort 'metadata' when you press apple+I.. however, these are just iTunes metadata. The pdf ones (which are embedded in the pdf file) won't be touched. So iTunes is not good too.

[PDF Meta Edit](http://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/PDF-MetaEdit-Download-61471.html). I did a bit of googling and found this free little app, but it looked like my operating system didn't like it (fyi, I'm running Snow Leopard).

### 2\. The Lifesaving Friends

[PDF-Meta](http://code.google.com/p/pdf-meta/). A small project hosted on googleCode. It's a simple java application, not particularly nice-looking but it does the job perfectly (and since it's java you've got more chances it'll work also on other operating systems).

[PDFInfo](http://www.sybrex.com/products/macgui/infomanager/download.php). Another small free app that does the job. This is OSx specific though, but it gives you control over a few more options compared to PDF-Meta.

\==+===

That's all I could find online... if you know of other solutions that work on OSx, please speak up!
