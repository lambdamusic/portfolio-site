I enjoyed watching a recent [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HV3M0NvyPM) by Barry Smith about ontology engineering and in particular its application in the field of philosophy itself. The presentation was hosted by the [InPho](https://inpho.cogs.indiana.edu/) team at Indian University, whose ongoing work based on creating an ontological backbone for [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) has drawn the attention of many.

[Barry Smith](http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/) is a prominent contributor to both theoretical and applied research in ontology. He is the author of many [publications](http://x.co/uSJQ) on ontology and related topics. In particular, the [Basic Formal Ontology](http://ifomis.uni-saarland.de/bfo/) is a widely used top level model in the scientific community.

**I'm a bit surprised** that there was no mention whatsoever of the work I did a while back in the context of the [PhiloSURFIcal project](http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/index.html). Built as part my [PhD](http://www.michelepasin.org/papers/21/), the PhiloSURFIcal software tool allowed to navigate a philosophical text, taking advantage of a map of the concepts relevant to the text. The map, in this case, relied on a rather generic [ontology for philosophy](http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/onto.html), which I instantiated using concepts from Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

At the time I could not find evidence for any other ontology modelling the philosophical domain, and still to this day I haven't seen any that provides the same level of detail in modeling out the various nuances of philosophical ideas.

Admittedly, the OWL formalization wasn't very good (in fact I originally implemented the ontology using a KR language called [OCML](http://technologies.kmi.open.ac.uk/ocml/)). Maybe though I should take this as an incentive to revive this work and publish it again using a more modern Linked Data approach!

A detailed summary of the modeling approach can be found here:
