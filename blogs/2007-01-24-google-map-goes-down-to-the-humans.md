> [Google Australia is celebrating Australia Day 2007 by photographing Sydney Harbour from the air](http://www.google.com/intl/en_au/events/australiaday2007/index.html), and we want to make sure as many of us as possible squeeze into the picture. So when you see the [Google branded plane](http://www.google.com/intl/en_au/events/australiaday2007/images/planephoto.jpg) flying overhead this January 26th, hoist a sign, arrange your family into a fun formation or just get a bunch of friends together to wave. The plane has permission to fly low and will be taking hi-resolution pictures like this one of people on 'Het Plein' in The Hague. Wear or do something distinctive to make sure you can spot yourself.

When are they coming to Milton Keynes?
