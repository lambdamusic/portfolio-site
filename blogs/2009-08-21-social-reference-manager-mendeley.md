A colleague mentioned the existence of [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) to me - a new and free reference manager. I've stuck with [Papers](http://mekentosj.com/papers/) for a while and was really really happy with it, but I have to admit that Mendeley seems to have quite a few cool features there.

For example: 1) it's **free** (and hopefully it'll remain like that forever) 2) it provides an **online counterpart**, so that you can check/manage your reference library online too 3) it's a **social application** - it aims at building up a community of researchers/users based on the categorization of one of their primary interests: papers 4) it can be used by researchers as a '**research homepage'** which features quite a lot about their academic profile..

Conclusion: definitely worth a try!
