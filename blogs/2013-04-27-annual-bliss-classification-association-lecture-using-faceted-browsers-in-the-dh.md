The [Bliss Bibliographic Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_bibliographic_classification) is a 'fully faceted classification scheme that provides a detailed classification for use in libraries and information services of all kinds, having a broad and detailed structure and order'. Last week I was invited to give a talk at the annual [Bliss Classification Association Lecture](http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/agm.shtml), held here in London at UCL university.

These are the slides from my talk, titled "_Exploring highly interconnected humanities data: are faceted browsers always the answer?_".

Essentially, this is a slightly revised version of the [paper](http://www.michelepasin.org/papers/30/) I presented a couple of years ago at the Digital Humanities conference in Stanford. It centres around the notion of '**pivoting**' in faceted browsers, the use of these tools in the digital humanities and some practical examples based on [DJFacet](http://www.michelepasin.org/software/djfacet/), an implementation of a customizable faceted search engine written in Python/Django.
