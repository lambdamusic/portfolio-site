Sometimes a **picture is more eloquent than a thousand words**. Well, a map can be too, and the maps by [Yanko Tsvetkov](http://alphadesigner.com/) proved the point for me. [Mapping stereotypes](http://alphadesigner.com/project-mapping-stereotypes.html) is a project in which he plots on a european map the way we (as British, French, Italians etc...) see the 'others'. The funny bit is that the pictures represent the most superficial, street-level, shallow views we have about our european neighbours...

Below, two maps from the [collection](http://alphadesigner.com/project-mapping-stereotypes.html): '**Europe according to USA**', and '**Europe according to Italy**'.
