I've started a new livecoding project on Github called [The Musical Code](https://github.com/lambdamusic/The-Musical-Code), where I'll be adding experimental musical code/algorithms created the amazing [Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) programming language (as well as it precursor [Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au/)).

I have accumulated so much musical-code ideas so I've finally resolved to clean it up, reorganise it and publish it somewhere. Github seemed the best option, these days:

Turns out that just the code by itself won't do it. Especially considering that the environments I use to 'run it' (and to make sounds) can rapidly disappear (become obsolete, or get out of fashion!).

Hence there's a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanqSICbxzRNEZGMlu8qfyw) as well, where one can find a screencast recording of each of the 'musical codes'.

Hope someone will find something of interest in there. Comments and feedback totally welcome!
