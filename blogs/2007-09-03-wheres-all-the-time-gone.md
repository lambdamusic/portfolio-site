just two news: PhiloSURFical development is proceeding well (had a lot of positive feedback at the Wittgenstein Symposium) and it has a [simple but shiny new site](http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/). And secondly - there's a [tabbed version of the Tractatus I've made using the Wittgenstein knowledge base](http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/tractatus/tabs.html)... can be useful to somebody, as it makes visually very clear the hierarchical structure of the text, try it out and leave a comment if you like it. The final version of the ontology-based tool should be finished in a month or so (the last famous words..) ..
