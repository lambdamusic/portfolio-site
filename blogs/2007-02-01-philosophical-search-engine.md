Hi guys! A new philosophical search engine is available out there. It's called [Noesis](http://noesis.evansville.edu/index.htm).

> Noesis is a limited area search engine for open access, academic philosophy. Built with Google's new Co-op program, Noesis allows users to search the combined webspace of our set of indexed professional associations, philosophy departments, faculty websites, online journals and reference works. Each area can also be searched independently. For more information, see http://noesis.evansville.edu/about.htm

So I tried to [look up "ontology"](http://noesis.evansville.edu/results.htm?cx=001558599338650237094%3Ad3zzyouyz0s&q=ontology&sa=Search&cof=FORID%3A11#1109)Â  - and see below what i got - how has Tom Gruber gained his top position? Do Plato and Husserl know that? I leave the interpretation to the readers...
