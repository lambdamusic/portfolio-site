I'm busy writing an article these days, which sort of feels like being in a long and tiring trip to the underworld.. So, since I can't really spend time on anything else but I still wanted to post something, here's a brief philosophy/technology related news:

> The [_IJIRE_ is the first peer-reviewed online journal, dedicated specifically to cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural research on Internet Research Ethics](http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/SOIS/cipr/ijire.html). All disciplinary perspectives, from those in the arts and humanities, to the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences, are reflected in the journal.

A little bit of background:

> With the emergence of Internet use as a research locale and tool throughout the 1990s, researchers from disparate disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to humanities to the sciences, have found a new fertile ground for research opportunities that differ greatly from their traditional biomedical counterparts. As such, "populations," locales, and spaces that had no corresponding physical environment became a focal point, or site of research activity. Human subjects protections questions then began to arise, across disciplines and over time: **What about privacy? How is informed consent obtained? What about research on minors? What are "harms" in an online environment? Is this really human subjects work?** More broadly, are the ethical obligations of researchers conducting research online somehow different from other forms of research ethics practices

So what is Internet Research Ethics?

> As Internet Research Ethics has developed as its own field and discipline, additional questions have emerged: **How do diverse _methodological_ approaches result in distinctive ethical conflicts and, possibly, distinctive ethical resolutions? How do diverse _cultural_ and _legal_ traditions shape** what are perceived as **ethical conflicts and permissible resolutions? How do researchers collaborating across diverse ethical and legal domains recognize and resolve ethical issues in ways that recognize and incorporate often markedly different ethical understandings?**
