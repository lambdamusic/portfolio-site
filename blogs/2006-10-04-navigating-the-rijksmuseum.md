The [Rijksmuseum](http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/index.jsp?lang=en) in Amsterdam is a very nice venue, and its paintings even better. You can have a detailed look at them, thanks to the beautiful website that also features an interesting navigation facility. Just click on "explore the collection ":

> Texts, photos, video and animation provide information on the Rijksmuseum's top exhibits. Links enable objects to be connected from the various departments of the museum's vast collection - joining a painting with a silver jug, for example, or a 19th-century landscape with its 17th-century forerunner. Access to the information is through four channels, based on artists' names, themes, encyclopaedic terms and a systematic catalogue.

Just clicking on one object or category triggers a snappy sequence of related objects - paintings mostly i suppose - which you can flick through and select for major information.

The metadata associated with the museum's artifacts have been extracted and processed in various projects. [TOPIA](http://db.cwi.nl/projecten/project.php4?prjnr=147) and the most recent [CHIP](http://www.chip-project.org/index.html) among them. This latter one lets users rate objects, then depending on these preferences (and of course on some ontology reasoning) the system outputs some "recommended" related objects. Nice and plain interface, worth having a look ([you need to register](http://www.chip-project.org:8091/demo/) though)!
