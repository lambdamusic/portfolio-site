The [British Wittgenstein Society (BWS)](http://www.britishwittgensteinsociety.herts.ac.uk/) is opening its doors (well online at least): it'll add up to the aready existing [Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society](http://www.alws.at/) (ALWS), [International German Ludwig Wittgenstein Society](http://www.ilwg.eu/) (ILWG) and [North American Wittgenstein Society](http://sorrel.humboldt.edu/~jwp2/naws.htm) (NAWS). I am trying to get [PhiloSURFical](http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/) noticed and possibly tested by them - let's see how it goes ;-)

From their site:

> "Our aim is to ensure that Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy continues to play a fertile and creative role in 21st century thought. The Society aspires to provide, through its annual conference, a British focal point for research and exchange of ideas among Wittgenstein scholars and students throughout the world. It will also seek to address, in its conference themes, the many other disciplines (psychology, anthropology, sociology, education sciences, aesthetics etc.) that Wittgenstein's work has impacted and will continue to impact.
> 
> The BWS will make an annual bursary available to a student who wishes to pursue PhD research on Wittgenstein at the University of Hertfordshire.
> 
> The British Wittgenstein Society is sponsored by Shell."
