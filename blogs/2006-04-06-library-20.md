I went to an interesting talk today about the future of library e-services, especially in the light of web 2.0 technologies. Quite interesting, a lot of ideas, maybe not groundbreaking yet but with a lot of potential i think. And quite a few people out there trying to make it real.

Check out the [Shared Innovation](http://www.talis.com/tdn/) blog for example, which gathers various initiatives. The guy who gave the talk is from [Talis](http://www.talis.com/home/), a company that "_provides the leading library management systems to the UK and Ireland library marketplace"._ So here are a couple of examples about opening up library services to the user-centred world of the web2:

- Dave Pattern has created a [script](http://www.daveyp.com/blog/index.php/archives/60/) for Firefox that mixes amazon's results with the local library's availability of the same book. Rationale: worth having a look before buying it no?
- The Ann Arbor District Library ([AADL](http://www.aadl.org/catalog)) instead lets users comment directly the books borrowed through a funny looking interface: enter a few words of comment and they are directly transformed into some scribble on the old-fashioned card-catalog.. cool! Users can say their opinion .. (next step would be structuring their agreements or disagreements and deploy some service that reasons on that...!)
- Last but not least, GoogleMaps mashups. For example [Libmap UK](http://www.talis.com/libmap/libmapuk2.html) lets you check libraries' catalogue through navigating a map of the UK.. a nice link to root planner and _et voila_ your day out on sunday (mm maybe during the week sounds better..) is planned!

Conclusion: The Open University library offers already a pretty brilliant service - still I do hope that some of these innovations will arrive soon here too (btw a service similar to greasymonkey already [exists](http://blogs.open.ac.uk/Maths/ajh59/006028.html)!)
