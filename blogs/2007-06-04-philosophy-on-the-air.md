It's nice to see the _ancient_ _philosophy_ keeping up with the new technologies - shows how the soul of philosophy is immortal, and linked to men instead of publication mechanisms. There's a new podcast available, [**Philosophy Bites**](http://www.philosophybites.com/), created by [Nigel Warburton](http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/philos/warburton.htm) (who teaches at the OU) and [David Edmonds](http://www.davidhigham.co.uk/html/Clients/David_Edmonds). The podcast makes available interviews on hot topics with eminent actual philosophers.

For example this week this is what's on:

> [Mary Warnock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Warnock,_Baroness_Warnock) who sits in the House of Lords and has chaired two important commissions - [special education needs](http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref18915.html) and on [human fertilisation and embryology](http://www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopall/ref21165.html) - discusses how her training in philosophy prepared her for these roles.

The other podcast you'd probably want to listen to, is the established Stanford-basedÂ  [Philosophy Talk](http://www.philosophytalk.org/).
