I really dig the concept - but after playing with it for a little I think that the whole thing is still too convoluted (lots of forms to fill in, popups etc.). Ideally, I'd just like to go to a website and start off the discussion, using their terminology, **annotate** it. Anyways, definitely worth having a go with [Blerp](http://www.blerp.com/), it's something that may develop further in the near future.

You'll find a good coverage of it also on [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/13/blerp-aims-to-turn-the-web-into-one-big-forum/):

> The web application it’s introducing today is dubbed [Blerp![](/media/static/blog_img/t.gif)](http://www.blerp.com/), and its ambition is to turn the Web into a giant interactive message board by making it possible for visitors to add text comments and multimedia to existing web pages and share them with their friends.

> Under the motto ‘layer the web!’, Blerp aims to enable people to enrich web pages with an additional layer of content with the ability to let others join in on the fun at any time. RocketOn is calling the concept Hyperlayers, and if the idea makes you think of social annotation services like [Reframe It](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/reframe-it), [Diigo](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/diigo) or [Fleck](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fleck), that’s because it’s taking an extremely similar route with Blerp.
