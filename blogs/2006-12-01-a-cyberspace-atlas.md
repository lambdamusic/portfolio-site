Wow half past ten friday night, I had a paper to finish and now I feel like my eyes are getting lost into the screen... just a brief post to conclude the week. I got a REALLY cool link about visualization from [Mark](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/marc/). Lots of classified projects, stuff which was not covered by more recent surveys because it's too old (but still very inspiring!).... [![](/media/static/blog_img/title.gif)](http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/atlas.html)

For example, I found out about ["HistoryWired: a Few of Our Favorite Things"](http://historywired.si.edu/) - an experimental program, which employs a visualization tool originally developed by smartmoney.com to display objects from the vast collections of the National Museum of American History. Amazing how it manages to **put into a single representation the semantic multidimensionality of the resources**!!!
