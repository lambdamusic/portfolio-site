Yesterday I finalized a song from last year.. it's called Japanese Terror in Sancasan. Weird title I know, but if you happen to see me live I'd be happy to tell you the story behind it (it's a bit personal). The song 's been originally made with [Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au/) (the repetitive japanese sounding line in the background is randomly generated) , post-processed a bit with [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) (added voices and so on), then passed on to my dear friend Andrea who added some nifty keyboards and re-processed the whole thing using [Cakewalk](http://www.cakewalk.com/Mac/). Thanks Andrea! I really love the end result.
