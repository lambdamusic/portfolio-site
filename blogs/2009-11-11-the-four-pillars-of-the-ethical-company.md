Some deeply inspiring and wise words I found in the [mystical Guitar Craft's website](http://www.guitarcraft.com/words), which is not a religious sect but one of the [creations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft) of unconventional 60's guitar hero [Robert Fripp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp) (best know for his work with [King Crimson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Crimson)). The Guitar Craft series of events is going to end on [its 25th anniversary](http://www.guitarcraft.com/calendar/173), this coming March, as [desire of Fripp himself](http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=13491). The website will close down too, so soon or later I feel I should do some copy&paste of all the interesting thoughts you can read in there..

## The Ethical Company

Recognisable features of the ethical company, in the literature and discussion of business ethics, involve these attributes:

> **Transparency Straightforwardness Accountability Owning-up Honesty Fairness Common decency Distributive justice**

Recognisable features of a company whose base is ethically challenged are these:

> **dissembling, use of threats, unkindness to employees, a widespread use of gagging orders, an inequitable distribution of company income.**

On the contrary, a company which would rather conduct its business:

> \- verbally (particularly with regard to disputed issues) instead of committing its views to writing; - commonly resorts to litigation, or employs the frequent threat of such; employs gagging clauses as standard policy; - pays its directors highly disproportionate sums in comparison with its employees;

...this company is suspect and should be avoided wherever possible.

It is a sad commentary on current business and public life that this needs to be written, or debated, says Fripp.

His thoughts can be summed up as follows:

> **transparency + straightforwardness = honesty accountability + owning-up = responsibility distributive justice + fairness = equity common decency = goodwill**

And the **Four Pillars of The Ethical Company** are:

> **Honesty Responsibility Equity Goodwil**l
