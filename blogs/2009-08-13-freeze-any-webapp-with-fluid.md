Just found out about [**FLuid**](http://fluidapp.com/) through the THisWeekInDjango podcast. It's a Site Specific Browser (SSBs) that lets you run each of your favorite WebApps as a separate desktop application. Fluid is an alternative to Mozilla's [Prism](http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/), another SSB that is much less integrated with the apple operating system.

> Are you a Gmail, Facebook, Campfire or Pandora fanatic? Do you have 20 or more browser tabs open at all times? Are you tired of some random site or Flash ad crashing your browser and causing you to lose your (say) Google Docs data in another tab? Fluid gives any WebApp a home on your Mac OS X desktop complete with Dock icon, standard menu bar, logical separation from your other web browsing activity, and many, many other goodies.

I had a go with it by creating a **DjangoDocs application** - usually I open up these docs a few times a day, but then inevitably forget which tabs I have opened, where they are etc. etc.... - with FLuid I can just have a separate application, save bookmarks within it, and many more features!
