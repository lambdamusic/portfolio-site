So hard to find time to do something creative these days. So I thought I'd post a screencast of a livecoded piece I'm still working on: _Ziggurat 51_. Hope you'll find it interesting!

In the video I'm using the mixer UI I've [previously talked about here](http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2013/09/15/building-a-master-volumes-ui-in-impromptu/). I quite like it, as you can see it's so much easier to focus on composition and performance by not having to worry about volumes in the code!

Also, since Impromptu's video recording functionality is broken on the latest versions of OSx, I've been testing out a new software called [Screenflick](http://www.araelium.com/screenflick), which is actually pretty good (apart from the logo you can't get rid of unless you buy the software).

Enjoy!
