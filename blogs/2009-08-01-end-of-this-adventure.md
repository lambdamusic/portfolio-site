.. and beginning of a new one.

I submitted my PhD thesis in september 2008, did the viva on january 13 2009 and handed in all the corrections last month (july). I'm officially done!

I started working for [London's CCH](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/depts/cch) in september 2008, so [you can reach me there now](http://staff.cch.kcl.ac.uk/~mpasin/) ;-)
