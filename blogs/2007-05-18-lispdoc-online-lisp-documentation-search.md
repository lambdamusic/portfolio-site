**I read this inon[Planet Lisp](http://planet.lisp.org/):**

> William Bland just [keeps on](http://abstractstuff.livejournal.com/30577.html) improving [lispdoc](http://lispdoc.com/), his online Lisp documentation search utility. The utility has a lot of neat features:
> 
> - A search brings up links to both the [CLHS](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/) and key CL books and also provides a usage example.
> - Content is provided from [Practical Common Lisp](http://gigamonkeys.com/book/) (PCL), [Successful Lisp](http://www.psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/cover.html), [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html), the [HyperSpec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/), and the docstrings of [SBCL](http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/) (and, soon, from [CLtL2](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html) as well).
> - Example code is from [Practical Common Lisp](http://gigamonkeys.com/book/), [PAIP](http://www.norvig.com/paip.html), [ANSI Common Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html), and a bunch of [ASDF-installable libraries](http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install).
> - There is a [Firefox plugin](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/download.html?name=lispdoc&sherlock=yes&opensearch=yes) that lets you do searches easily in Firefox.
> - There is an [htmlize utility](http://lispdoc.com/htmlize) that lets you input a snippet of lisp code and get a colorized HTML representation of that code (convenient for quickly getting something that you can put in a web page).
> - It provides documentation lookup for a lot of [commonly-used CL libraries](http://lispdoc.com/packages).
> - You can input search terms in a manner similar to SLIME's "fuzzy-complete" (e.g. - if you enter "m-v-b" in the search dialog, it returns the documentation for "multiple-value-bind").
