Since I've got to annotate and reorganize a large set of text data, I guess I willl have to visualize them too at some point. This part of the job is really exciting I must say. Somehow, i have a _visual mind_ (whatever that means). So I had a look around to check hat's around, see some examples and gather some inspiration. I found a great lot of [interesting material on visualization here](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2005/cmsc838s/viz4all/viz4all_a.html "visualization survey"), and I'll keep looking for interesting sources. Please leave a comment if there's something I should be aware of!! Of course, what's of interest is mainly **visualizing documents**, but not only. The following list is just a very little taste of what visualization can do. I'm amazed by the quantity of projects existing out there... ! Two other interesting links are the [Information Visualization Community wiki](http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page "you MUST bookmark this!"), and [Visual Complexity](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/ "make it visual, make it simple!"). **TEXTARC**

This tool is used to [visualize the text of Shakespeare's Hamlet](http://textarc.org/Hamlet2.html). Result is interesting and visually appealing, but it also gets confusing when trying to use it, and the navigation advantage it's not totally clear.. There's also another project looking at how to render Shakespeare's works in novel ways, but it's focuses only in [social networks](http://www.jibble.org/shakespeare/) .

**VISUAL THESAURUS**

For 40$ you can buy [this product](http://www.visualthesaurus.com), that looks pretty useful. It's a network visualization applied to synonyms (and antonyms) in language. Easy way to search for terms in a thesaurus, through colored links, arrows and definitions popping up.

**THEY RULE**

[This one](http://www.theyrule.net/2004/tr2.php "unfortunately THEY rule") really impressed me. It's a representation of the relationships between some of America's largest corporations. It povides a fascinating insight into corporate America, and the user-driven expansion and discovery of the people's affiliations (the _rulers_), through clickling and dragging, enhance the feeling of an active engagement in the navigation process.

**NEWSMAP**

It's a treemap [visualization of the Google news headline stories](http://www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/newsmap.cfm "coloured news"). It helps distinguishing types of news through the colors used. The ability to focus on a particular international or categorical view of the news also mirrors more traditional news sources.

**LIVE PLASMA**

It's a [pretty visualization](http://www.liveplasma.com/ "bubbles flashing around") which shares some issues with many other node-link diagrams. Colored bubbles surrounded by lines and circles attempt to visualize the closure among nodes (representing musical acts, actors, or movies).

**GAPMINDER**

[Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/about.htm "PPoints on demand") is a non-profit venture for development and provision of free software that visualise human development. This visualization tool turns boring time series of development statistics into attractive moving graphics. The software imports data from excel and shows moving graphics on the screen, that can be exported as Flash files or as images in PowerPoint and in other formats.
