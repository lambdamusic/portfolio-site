Basically, [you go to the site](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php), download 100megs of stuff, move it to your applications folder (of course, I'm talking about a mac) and run it. There you go: apache, php5, mysql running independently from any other implementation you have already installed. In less than 2 minutes!

Even [Marc Liyanage](http://www.entropy.ch/home/welcome.php), who's been distributing this sort of all-in-one solutions for a long time, [admitted](http://www.entropy.ch/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2506) that it's cool :-)
