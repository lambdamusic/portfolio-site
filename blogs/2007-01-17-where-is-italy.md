It's not nig news that italy is economically sinking, but [this map](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/350816052_0a392a0d28_o.jpg) makes my skin crawl... it compares each american state's economic output to another country's [GDP](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/199.asp). But where is italy? I'm not strong in economy but it doesnt feel good seeing it not in there...
