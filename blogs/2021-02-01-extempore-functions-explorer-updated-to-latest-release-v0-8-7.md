The Extempore functions explorer has been updated with the latest version of the Extempore programming language: [v0.8.7](https://github.com/digego/extempore/tree/v0.8.7)

> Try it out at: [http://hacks2019.michelepasin.org/extempore/](http://hacks2019.michelepasin.org/extempore/)

The Extempore functions explorer is a little webapp I built a while ago in order to make it easier to browse (and learn about) the Extempore music-programming language.
