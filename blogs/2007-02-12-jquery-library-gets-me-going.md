Following suggestions which turned out to be really good, I've found myself having a lot of fun with the [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) library. It's immensely easy to use, and beautiful to see its results. Plenty of [tutorials](http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials) around, and people developing widgets. Have a look at the [interface elements](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos), for example. Or at the cool [fisheye menu](http://interface.eyecon.ro/docs/fisheye)..or the handy [TreeView.](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/)
