Yesterday I went to the [CAA 2012](http://caaconference.org/) conference in Southampton, one of the top conferences in the world in the field of [computational archaeology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_archaeology). I couldn't stay for longer than a day, but I've seen enough to say that archaeologist definitely know their way around when it comes to combining IT with their discipline.

I presented a poster about the [Art of Making project](http://www.artofmaking.ac.uk/) (which deals with categorising and making available online a collection of images of ancient Roman sculpture). In particular I was there for the **Data Modelling and Sharing** session: the formal ontology we're working on in the Art of Making (and the accompanying dataset) is likely going to become one of the first in its kind. So I was quite interested in finding out who's doing what, when it comes to sharing data about the the ancient world.

The answer is, there are a lot of people doing very interesting things (btw please get in touch if you know of other relatable datasets). Here're a brief report on some the papers that struck me (for the full list of the talks I would have liked to attend, check out [my interactive schedule](http://caaconference2012.sched.org/mpasin).)

- A [paper on the Pelagios project](http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/b8dba5f531a7d2c41faebf303865357e) by Leif Isaksen. Pelagios is a consortium that **brings together** an impressive number of other **datasets** on the ancient world. I'd say each of them is worth taking a look at: [Arachne](http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/); [CLAROS](http://explore.clarosnet.org/XDB/ASP/clarosHome/); [Fasti Online](http://www.fastionline.org/); [Google Ancient Places](http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/); [Nomisma](http://nomisma.org/); [Open Context](http://opencontext.org/); [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/); [Pleiades](http://pleiades.stoa.org/); [Ptolemy Machine](http://ptolemymachine.appspot.com/), [SPQR](http://spqr.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/); [Ure museum](http://www.reading.ac.uk/Ure/index.php)

- A [paper titled "When, What, Where, How and Who?"](http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/5cbf48abc47a735213ea2f95e5b55fce) by Sarah May. She reported about a **user-study aimed at understanding how archeologist search for information online**, and whether an more integrated web of data would match their current information seeking behaviours.

- The paper "[Exploring Semantic Web-based research questions for the spatio-temporal relationships at Çatalhöyük](http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/efe75fbdd784b8c73d0938e4591af1b0)", by [Holly Wright](http://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/research/research-students/holly-wright/). She presented an archeological data-modeling scenario that calls for **more powerful knowledge representation approaches to time and events**. There are two broad approaches to solve this problem, she said: **temporal reification** (apparently this is mostly done using SWRL rules, e.g. [here](http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/events/swap2010/paper-04.pdf) and [here](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbmir.stanford.edu%2Ffile_asset%2Findex.php%2F1534%2FBMIR-2010-1414.pdf&ei=9BZzT7WaFYfB0QWvn9T5Dw&usg=AFQjCNFwmhf_HaJxEQMq1lI-hl-B8YpSww)) and **temporal fluents** (some info [here](https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=sea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=temporal+fluents), and also in the context of the [SOWL](http://www.defeasible.org/ruleml2011ijcai/files/Batsakis.pdf) project). I don't know much on this topic, but surely this paper got me interested in it!
- A paper presenting the [SAWS](http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/394231b4c4a4ad537ce3cf314e983fb2) project, which looks at defining and **linking related units of text in original manuscripts** using semantic web technologies.
- The [Archeology Data Services](http://data.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/page/), a York-based organisation that aims at '**preserving digital data in the long term**, and by promoting and disseminating a broad range of data in archaeology'. In particular one of their project, [Stellar](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/research/stellar/), has produced a [number of software tools](http://hypermedia.research.glam.ac.uk/resources/STELLAR-applications/) that facilitate the manipulation of archeological data and their transformation into rdf-compliant formats.

Finally, this is the schedule for the whole conference (notice the slick widget - it's powered by a new service [sched.org](http://sched.org/)) :
