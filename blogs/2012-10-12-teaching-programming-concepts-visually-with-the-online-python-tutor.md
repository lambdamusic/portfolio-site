The Online Python Tutor is a Web-based program visualization for CS education, developed in collaboration with Google. It provides an easy-to-use online environment for writing code and testing it interactively. A great resource for teaching computer science concepts!

> As part of his CS education work at [Google](http://research.google.com/index.html), [Philip Guo](https://plus.google.com/117790530324740296539/posts/f2XggMgZtaQ) has been developing an open-source educational tool called [Online Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/). This tool enables teachers and students to write Python programs directly in the web browser and then single-step forwards and backwards to visualize what the computer is doing as it executes those programs. The tool has already been used by over 100,000 people but has a lot of potential for advancement. Philip is actively seeking partnerships with educators at all grade levels to deploy and [improve](https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/docs/project-ideas.md) the Online Python Tutor tool. Visit the [URL](http://www.pythontutor.com/) for more information on using the tool and how to get involved.

### Create, Test, Share

Once you've created a program, you can also share it online via a url, or get a snippet of code that will let you embed it in your site. Which is pretty neat! For example:

<iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="http://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def+factorial(n)%3A%0A++++if+n+%3D%3D+1%3A%0A++++++++return+1%0A++++else%3A%0A++++++++return+n+*+(factorial(n-1))%0A%0Aprint+factorial(5)&amp;cumulative=false&amp;py=2&amp;curInstr=0"></iframe>
