Just found a very cool app that lets you organize and store the navigation on any mediawiki site, [Pathway](http://pathway.screenager.be/2006/11/25/pathway-06/). It basically represents visually the link's structure of a wiki-page, all the departing nodes centered around the page of interest. The whole navigation can thus be stored in the form of a a net with nodes and links! Developed in **Cocoa**, works easily and fast on any mac (intel based as well) running Tiger! I quote the author's reasons behind the development:

> My idea for Pathway originated when browsing Wikipedia. I would always start off quite focused on a certain subject. Unfortunately, Wikipedia articles tend to be full of distracting links, just screaming to be clicked onâ€¦ Soon enough, I found myself totally lost in _myriads_ of loosely related pages. I canâ€™t count the time I wasted on backtracing them, and if you have a bit of wiki-experience, youâ€™ve probably encountered it too. What I needed, was an **application that could easily archive the path I follow through Wikipedia** pages.
