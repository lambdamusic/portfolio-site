Just wanted to flag up SO-Clone, an interesting project on [googleCode](http://code.google.com/p/soclone/) that wants to replicate the fundamental functionalities of Stack Overflow.

> If you'd like to run a site like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), for example on your company's intranet for internal use by developers, keep an eye on this project, which aims to implement a Stack Overflow-like site in Django.
> 
> SOClone will make use of [Progressive Enhancement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) to ensure that all core functionality is available regardless of whether or not the user has JavaScript enabled - some of Stack Overflow's core functionality such as voting, accepting answers, viewing comments, marking questions as favourites and flagging questions as offensive currently doesn't work _at all_ without JavaScript enabled.

...

#### \[4/10/10\] Update:

another project that (judging from reviews here and there) managed to clone Stack Overflow even more successfully is [CNPROG](https://github.com/cnprog/CNPROG)
