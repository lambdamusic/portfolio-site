It looks like the semantic web rumor is spreading out fast, also in the philosophy circles:

> [Discovery](http://www.discovery-project.eu/index.html) is co-financed by the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/) under the _[e](http://europa.eu.int/information_society/activities/econtentplus/)_[Content_plus_ programme](http://europa.eu.int/information_society/activities/econtentplus/) and was launched in November 2006. It has a twofold aim:
> 
> 1. to prepare an extensive collection of scholarly editions of primary sources and scholarly contributions for the study of philosophy from the Presocratics through modernity; to enrich this material with metadata and develop philosophically informed ontologies that will semantically structure it; and to publish the enriched content via a federation of inter-operable websites called _Philosource_.
> 2. to build an advanced digital workspace for philosophical research using a desktop application â€“ called _Philospace_ â€“ with which scholars can exploit the resources of the _Philosource_ contents and engage in collaborative research projects with optimal efficiency through peer-to-peer (p2p) networking.
> 
> _Philosource_ will be the data provider, much like a digital library or archive; _Philospace_ will be an advanced working environment for philosophers, enabling them to perform sophisticated queries, apply inference rules and, above all, semantically enrich the data published on the websites. The _Philosource_ federation will rely on the stringent peer review standards traditionally used in academic publishing for quality control, while _Philospace_ will be an open venue with user-selected filtering for information management. _Philospace_ will overlie and extend _Philosource_, enriching its content with non-reviewed information. Scholars working in _Philospace_ will be able to submit the results of their research to _Philosource_ for peer review and, if successful, publication.
> 
> The software underlying both _Philosource_ and _Philospace_ will be based on the extension and adaptation of already existing Open Source applications, primarily _Hyper_ and _[Dbin](http://dbin.org/)_

Looking forward to seeing some results there!
