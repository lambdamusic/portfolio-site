Gmail's labels are great for they let you organize your constantly growing mailbox in a non-final way. That is, using the ['tagging' concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)), you can assign the same tag to multiple items, or different tags to the same items, add/remove tags etc etc. All of this is [well known and documented](http://www.gilsmethod.com/using-gmails-new-label-management-feature#top). One thing though still surprises me. Why the heck can't we set the labels' order arbitrarily? (now they are automatically sorted alphabetically).

I have dozens of labels, and know the too-many-emails problem has just moved one level up: [too many labels](http://groups.google.com/group/gmail-labs-help-remove-labels-from-subjects/browse_thread/thread/156bd401a0f92402?pli=1), don't remember why I've created them and what their intended use was. As a result, I end up losing a lot of time just figuring out where things are in my mailbox...

So being able to sort them arbitrarily could be handy here... I did a bit of [research online](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&expIds=17259,24683,24815,26637,27045&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=gmail+sorting+labels&cp=20&pf=p&sclient=psy&aq=f&aqi=g4g-o1&aql=&oq=gmail+sorting+labels&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=8ef567fbf90c3874) and it looks like this is not possible. Mmmm funny init? Insurmountable technical difficulty? Trivial interaction-design mistake? Who knows. So it looks like as the only workaround to manage gmail labels is to prefix them using alphabetical characters. [As simple as that](http://www.jeetblog.com/trick-to-manage-gmail-labels/).

By the way, the 'alphabetical' ordering used by gmail is not what you might be used to, but the one below:
