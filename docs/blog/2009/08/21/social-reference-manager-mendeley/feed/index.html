					<description><![CDATA[Teri, could you please contact support@mendeley.com with these details along with the version of Mendeley you&#039;re using, what operating system you&#039;re using, etc? We&#039;ll get back to you quickly with a solution. :)

Anyhow, if you&#039;re using linux it looks like you may need to install python-uno
In command line you&#039;ll need to run something like (if Debian, Ubuntu, etc):
apt-get install python-uno

If this is not your case, just drop support@mendeley.com a line and we&#039;ll get back to you asap!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like the interface, and I would like to keep using Mendeley. However,
I cannot seem to be able to insert citations into an Open Office document. When I select Tools -&#062; Install OpenOffice Plugin, I get an error saying &quot;Couldn&#039;t Install OpenOffice Plugin. Please re-run the installer, enable the Python-UNO Bridge component and try again.&quot;

This is probably simple but I spent 30 minutes trying to figure this out, and I still don&#039;t have a solution: How do I enable this component?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks for the nice words. We&#039;re glad you like it.

Let me assure you that whatever is currently available for free, will remain free! We will however be introducing some premium features at a later time that will have a minor fee. But again, whatever is free now, will stay free! :)

Cheers,
