					<description><![CDATA[Do you have formal meetings, or ad hoc gatherings?

I used to tinker a bit with epistemic logics, in particular issues of common belief and mutual knowledge, when i was working on an agent teamwork project (eg http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/tony/doc/ijcai99ws.doc and http://robofesta.open.ac.uk/tony/doc/wsc4diffobj.doc (which is very flakey!) Both very dated now...)

I&#039;ve been wondering recently how we can architect knowledge sharing tools that draw on formal representations of common knowledge etc to support knowledge networks within a hardcore team, and a softer extended group. 

(Halpern has recently started looking at infinite groups, I think?)

If you can also find a way to overlay the logical conditions for mutual/commopn knowledge/belief onto social graphs/sociograms or similar, you could maybe find ways of improving knowledge flow within communities with hard and soft edges?

Or not..may be just a big red herring!]]></description>
