					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mikele,

if you do decide to give Clojure more of your time these are the resources I found most useful whilst learning and might be of interest to you:

First up is this talk by Rich. It&#039;s pretty mind bending from a programming language perspective and gives great insight into the philosophy behind Clojure:
http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey

Next is an interesting Microsoft interview featuring an unusually out-gunned Beckman:
http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Expert-to-Expert-Rich-Hickey-and-Brian-Beckman-Inside-Clojure

I&#039;d also recommend you watch this talk on Clojure&#039;s concurrency features. It&#039;s a little old but still highly relevant:
http://blip.tv/file/812787

Finally there&#039;s the upcoming Manning book The Joy of Clojure which I found to be an excellent read:
