								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some deeply inspiring and wise words I found in the <a href="http://www.guitarcraft.com/words">mystical Guitar Craft&#8217;s website</a>, which is not a religious sect but one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Craft">creations</a> of unconventional 60&#8217;s guitar hero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp">Robert Fripp</a> (best know for his work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Crimson">King Crimson</a>). The Guitar Craft series of events is going to end on <a href="http://www.guitarcraft.com/calendar/173">its 25th anniversary</a>, this coming March, as <a href="http://www.dgmlive.com/diaries.htm?entry=13491">desire of Fripp himself</a>. The website will close down too, so soon or later I feel I should do some copy&amp;paste of all the interesting thoughts you can read in there..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thegce-img_03.gif"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thegce-img_03.gif" alt="Thegce img 03" border="0" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<h2>The Ethical Company</h2>
<p>Recognisable features of the ethical company, in the literature and discussion of business ethics, involve these attributes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Transparency<br />
Straightforwardness<br />
Accountability<br />
Owning-up<br />
Honesty<br />
Fairness<br />
Common decency<br />
Distributive justice</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Recognisable features of a company whose base is ethically challenged are these:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>dissembling,<br />
use of threats,<br />
unkindness to employees,<br />
a widespread use of gagging orders,<br />
an inequitable distribution of company income.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, a company which would rather conduct its business:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8211; verbally (particularly with regard to disputed issues) instead of committing its views to writing;<br />
&#8211; commonly resorts to litigation, or employs the frequent threat of such; employs gagging clauses as standard policy;<br />
&#8211; pays its directors highly disproportionate sums in comparison with its employees;
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;this company is suspect and should be avoided wherever possible. </p>
<p>It is a sad commentary on current business and public life that this needs to be written, or debated, says Fripp. </p>
<p>His thoughts can be summed up as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>transparency + straightforwardness = honesty<br />
accountability + owning-up = responsibility<br />
distributive justice + fairness = equity<br />
common decency = goodwill</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>And the <strong>Four Pillars of The Ethical Company</strong> are:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Honesty<br />
Responsibility<br />
Equity<br />
Goodwil</strong>l</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I decided to have a go with the already-famous <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=guitarrig3">Guitar Rig 3</a> (a music production software for guitarists, including amplifiers, effects etc etc). Here&#8217;s the official blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>GUITAR RIG 3 is the ultimate all-in-one guitar and bass solution. Simply connect your guitar with your computer via the enhanced Rig Kontrol 3 foot pedal and you are ready to go. The on-board studio-quality soundcard routes the signal to your speakers, while the s<strong>oftware grants you access to an incredible number of perfectly modeled classic amps, cabinets, mics and effects</strong> &#8211; all arranged in a super-simple drag-and-drop rack format. Any style, any time &#8211; the perfect solution for professional studio and live setups.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the Native Instrument site <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=gr3demo&amp;L=1&amp;ftu=da112cc2d395eae">you can download a demo version</a>, so I did and set off to have some fun with my guitar.. obviously <strong>I didn&#8217;t have the Rig Kontrol 3 foot pedal, but the instructions said it was possible to use the software just as a virtual instrument</strong> &#8211; that is by plugging your guitar directly into the line-in of the mac (as I don&#8217;t have an external audio interface yet).</p>
<p>Unfortunately <strong>it wasn&#8217;t that easy</strong> &#8211; the audio controls of Guitar Rig didn&#8217;t allow me to choose my mac&#8217;s LineIn, so no sound at all !!!</p>
<p>I googled the issue quite a bit, found out that <a href="http://media.locals.ca/localsconf/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=142965">other people run into the same problem</a>.</p>
<p>Thus I emailed directly the guys at Native Instruments, and (I wasnt expecting this) they got back to me after a couple of days!!! Thanks Nadine!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s their feedback &#8211; thought it could have been useful to other mac users:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to fix this problem, please create an &#8220;Aggregate Device&#8221;.</p>
<p>An Aggregate Device is an audio interface that virtually exists in your</p>
<p>computer. It uses audio inputs and outputs of one or more real audio</p>
<p>interfaces which are connected to your computer.</p>
<p><strong>How to setup a generated device:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Open the OS X &#8220;Audio and MIDI setup&#8221; (MacHD/Applications/Utilities) and</p>
<p>click on Audio -&gt; Open aggregate device editor.</p>
<p>&#8211; By clicking on the &#8220;+&#8221; button you can add a new device. Below you should see</p>
<p>a list of real audio interfaces currently connected to your computer. Click on</p>
<p>the check box to enable interfaces as needed for this aggregate device. Close</p>
<p>the editor when done.</p>
<p>&#8211; In the Audio settings window of the audio application you can now choose</p>
<p>this &#8220;aggregate device&#8221; as your output device.</p>
<p>&#8211; For Native Instruments standalone applications also setup the inputs and</p>
<p>outputs as necessary under the Audio settings window/tab Routing.</p>
<p>Nadine, Native Instruments Support Team</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know anything about <a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/techniques/aggregateaudio/">Aggregate Audio</a>,  it&#8217;s really really nice. For example it lets you manage your audio-input ports in such a way that you can use more than one at the same time, e.g. <a href="http://www.thegaragedoor.com/tutorials/agg.html">recording more than one instrument at the same time with Garage Band</a>.</p>
<p>So I tried to<strong> create a &#8216;virtual&#8217; audio device </strong>using the Aggregate Device menu-option in the Audio-Midi-Setup utility (<strong>update 22/11/09:</strong> if you&#8217;re on SnowLeopard the Audio-Midi-Setup app looks a bit different, but what follows is till valid!).<br />
Unfortunately it didn&#8217;t let me do that &#8211; every time I was making some changes to <strong>these settings they were not stored properly</strong> (on SnowLeopard the newly created device flashes and disappears every time).<br />
Some more googling, <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/static/discussionsbacksoon.html?messageID=8223201">got an answer here</a>. It&#8217;s an <strong>issue with unix privileges</strong> on the <em>.GlobalSettings.plist</em> file (in <em>/Library/Preferences</em>). Even if I&#8217;m an admin user, for some reasons the system doens&#8217;t let me change that file, so I can&#8217;t change the Aggregate Device options too.</p>
<p>After trying various options suggested in <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/static/discussionsbacksoon.html?messageID=8223201">this</a> apple forum, I discovered that the <strong>only solution that worked for me was changing the privileges</strong> on the Preferences folder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-41 aligncenter" title="Change_privileges" src="http://magicrebirth.webfactional.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-11.png" alt="Change_privileges" width="480" height="613" srcset="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-11.png 599w, http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-11-234x300.png 234w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>I know,<strong> it&#8217;s not really advisable to allow any user to change those prefs</strong> &#8211; but I took he risk.. I&#8217;m usually the only one using this mac. So if this is not the case for you, better look for another option..</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it &#8211; now all you have to do is<strong> change the settings in GuitarRig</strong>:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>News for all the guitarists and music technology lovers: the <a href="http://www.sourceaudio.net/index.php">Source Audio</a> Hot Hand motion control for guitar effects. An innovative way to control the guitar sound in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">theremin</a>-like manner! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s.html/103-5983998-7207802?ie=UTF8&#038;node=11965861&#038;brand=SourceAudio">Amazon</a> lets you buy it for only 300$ now! Watch the video below to see it in action&#8230;</p>
<p>The Hot Handâ„¢ system is a patent pending technology that uses micro-machined motion sensors to translate movement and position into control signals for use in guitar effects. The system provides an unprecedented level of control and expressiveness and offers the artist a new way of manipulating effects.</p>
