								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have never heard about this before, but as it turns out OS X comes with the simulated therapy program, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>, pre-installed. Eliza was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966, and it was one of the early examples of natural language processing.</p>
<p>On OSX, Eliza is &#8216;hidden&#8217; inside the eMacs application. Here&#8217;s how you can open it: in the Terminal application type <em>emacs</em> and hit enter. When the editor has loaded, <em>hold shift and hit the escape key</em>. Then type <em>xdoctor</em> and hit return. Answer the first question and proceed from there. When you&#8217;re done, <em>control-X control-C</em> will quit the editor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-30-at-16.26.35.png"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-30-at-16.26.35.png" alt="Screen shot 2011 05 30 at 16 26 35" height="250" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Janet Murray, in her classic cyber-narrative book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hamlet-Holodeck-Future-Narrative-Cyberspace/dp/0262631873">Hamlet on the Holodeck</a> describes the invention with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The resulting persona, Eliza, was that of a Rogerian therapist, the kind of cliniciam who echoes back the concerns of the patient without interpretation.<br />
[&#8230;]<br />
To Weizenbaum&#8217;s dismay, a wide range of people, including his own secretary, would &#8220;demand to be permitted to converse with the system in private, and would, after conversing with it for a time, insist, in spite of [Weizenbaum&#8217;s] explanations, that the machine really understood them.&#8221;<br />
[&#8230;]<br />
Weizenbaum had set out to make a clever computer program and had unwittingly created a believable character. He was so disconcerted by his achievement that he wrote a book warning of the dangers of attributing human thought to machines.</p></blockquote>
