								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus.html">Europeana</a> is a multilingual digital collection containing more than 15 millions resources that lets you explore Europe&#8217;s history from ancient times to the modern day. Europeana API services are web services allowing search and display of Europeana collections in your website and applications. The folks at Europeana have been actively promoting the experimentation with their APIs by organizing &#8216;hackathons&#8217; &#8211; workshops for cultural informatics hackers where new ideas and discussed and implemented. </p>
<p>Some examples of the outputs of the previous hackathon can be found <a href="http://version1.europeana.eu/web/api/hackathon-prototypes">here</a>. Hack4Europe is the most recent of these dissemination activities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hack4Europe! is a series of hack days organised by the Europeana Foundation and its partners Collections Trust, Museu Picasso, Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center and Swedish National Heritage Board. The hackathon roadshow will be held simultaneously in 4 locations (London, Barcelona, Poznan and Stockholm) in the week 6 &#8211; 12 June and will provide an exciting environment to explore the potential of open cultural data for social and economic growth in Europe.</p>
<p>Each hackathon will bring together up to 30 developers from the hosting country and the surrounding area. They will have access to the diverse and rich <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/">Europeana collections</a> containing over 18 million records, Europeana Search API (incl. a test key and <a href="http://europeanalabs.eu/wiki/EuropeanaOpenSearchAPI">technical documentation</a>) and Europeana Linked Open Data Pilot datasets which currently comprise about 3 million Europeana records available under a CC0 license.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes a <strong>picture is more eloquent than a thousand words</strong>. Well, a map can be too, and the maps by <a href="http://alphadesigner.com/">Yanko Tsvetkov</a> proved the point for me. <a href="http://alphadesigner.com/project-mapping-stereotypes.html">Mapping stereotypes</a> is a project in which he plots on a european map the way we (as British, French, Italians etc&#8230;) see the &#8216;others&#8217;. The funny bit is that the pictures represent the most superficial, street-level, shallow views we have about our european neighbours&#8230;    </p>
<p>Below, two maps from the <a href="http://alphadesigner.com/project-mapping-stereotypes.html">collection</a>: &#8216;<strong>Europe according to USA</strong>&#8216;, and &#8216;<strong>Europe according to Italy</strong>&#8216;.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I&#8217;ll start using this mostly technical blog to help in spreading the word about the incredible political situation in italy. What I&#8217;m talking about? You can probably catch up on the latest from corrupted Italy by reading <a href="http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/">Beppe Grillo&#8217;s blog</a>&#8230;.. it&#8217;s good for a laugh too, if you dont feel like talking about politics.</p>
<p>Anyways &#8211; the most recent one is the supreme selection of candidates the italian parties are sending to Bruxelles for the EU parliament. <a href="http://www.voglioscendere.ilcannocchiale.it/">Travaglio</a> docet:</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KAppZDz7c8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>If you&#8217;re not lucky enough to understand italian, there&#8217;s a nice <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6150318.ece">article by The Times about it</a>, titled &#8216;<strong>The beauty of democracy as Silvio Berlusconi picks model MEP candidates</strong>&#8216;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Silvio Berlusconi has an eye for pretty girls with a background in showbusiness and has brought some of them into parliament and even his Cabinet to brighten up politics.</p>
<p>Even by his standards, though, Mr Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, has chosen a striking roster of candidates to give his party a new face for the European Parliament elections in June, including a <em>Big Brother</em> star and a Miss Italy contestant.</p>
<p>None has any known political experience although Angela Sozio, 36, a flame-haired former contestant of <em>Grande Fratello</em>, the Italian version of <em>Big Brother,</em> made the headlines two years ago when the paparazzi photographed her and other showgirls strolling hand-in-hand with Mr Berlusconi, 72, at Villa Certosa, his villa in Sardinia.</p>
<p>The photographs, which appeared in the mass circulation magazine <em>Oggi</em> under the headline “Berlusconi’s Harem”, showed some of the women sitting on the Prime Minister’s knee. He insisted that he was being hospitable in showing the women round his seaside estate while his wife, the former actress Veronica Lario, was at her villa near Milan [&#8230;&#8230;.continues&#8230;.]</p></blockquote>
