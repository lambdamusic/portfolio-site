								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Italian government recently announced a new portal containing data on public spending: <a href="http://soldipubblici.gov.it">http://soldipubblici.gov.it</a>. This is obviously great news; the website is still in beta though so in what follows I&#8217;d like to put forward a few (hopefully constructive) comments and desires for how it could/should be developed further. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I recently ran into <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmakgill">Ian Makgill</a> from <a href="http://spendnetwork.com/">spendnetwork.com/</a>, a London startup funded by the <a href="http://opendatainstitute.org/start-ups/spend-network">Open Data Institute</a> which looks at using <em>open public data to create the first comprehensive and publicly available repository for government transaction data</em>.  </p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/101522232" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We ended up chatting about the situation with <strong>open government data in Italy</strong>. To be honest I&#8217;m no expert on the matter but a couple of names quickly came to mind. </p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, the excellent <a href="http://www.openpolis.it/eng/">OpenPolis</a> association. Their mission is <em>to enable free access to public information on political candidates, elected representatives, and legislative activity thus promoting <a href="http://blog.openpolis.it/2014/09/29/foia-4-italy-ricordiamo-renzi-gli-impegni-preso-diritto-accesso/#more-2981">transparency</a> and the democratic participation of Italian citizens</em>. </p>
<p>One of their most successful projects is <a href="http://parlamento.openpolis.it/">Open Parliament</a> (similar in scope to <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">theyworkforyou.com</a> in the UK). More recently the <a href="http://www.openbilanci.it/">Open Bilanci</a> platform was created so to allow citizens to search&#038;compare the budgets and expenses of municipalities (local boroughs) in Italy.    </p>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-22.44.34.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-22.44.34.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014 12 22 at 22 44 34" style="width: 600px; " border="0" width="600"  /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-23-at-10.52.45.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-23-at-10.52.45.png"  alt="Screen Shot 2014 12 23 at 10 52 45" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, the ongoing work done by the <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, which also has an <a href="http://it.okfn.org/">Italian charter</a>. For example one of its long-standing projects, <a href="https://openspending.org">openspending.org</a>, contains references to several <a href="https://openspending.org/search?q=italy">datasets about Italy&#8217;s public spending</a>. </p>
<p>Another useful resource is the <a href="http://it-city.census.okfn.org/">Italia open data census</a>, a community driven initiative to <em>compare the progress made by different cities and local areas in releasing Open Data</em>. </p>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-22.42.47.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-22.42.47.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014 12 22 at 22 42 47" style="width: 600px; " border="0" width="600"  /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Soldipubblici.gov.it: a first look</h3>
<p>It should be clear by now that the people behind <a href="http://soldipubblici.gov.it/it/home">soldipubblici.gov.it</a> are not the only ones looking at increasing transparency and democracy by releasing open data. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s <strong>not clear at all</strong> though, is whether these different groups are <strong>talking to each other</strong> &#8211; which would seem the most obvious thing to do before embarking on a new enterprise like this. Especially since soldipubblici.gov.it is strikingly <strong>similar</strong> (in scope) to the aforementioned <a href="http://www.openbilanci.it/">Open Bilanci</a> portal. I&#8217;m sure that both the folks at the OKFN and openpolis.org would be interested in getting their hands on these data so to integrate them with their existing services.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s great to hear that more is happening in this space. Even more so because it&#8217;s the Italian government who&#8217;s taking responsibility for it this (as it <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>should</span> be).  </p>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-23-at-11.14.52.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-23-at-11.14.52.png"  alt="Screen Shot 2014 12 23 at 11 14 52" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the good news. The bad news is that, from a data perspective, <strong>there isn&#8217;t much you can do with the <a href="http://soldipubblici.gov.it/">soldipubblici.gov.it</a></strong> in this beta release. If one wants to put these data to use there are various key elements missing I believe. Here&#8217;s a few ideas:  </p>
<li><strong>There is no way to <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>browse</span>/<span style='text-decoration:underline;'>review</span> the data</strong>. Search is good, but if you have no idea what to search for (e.g. simply because you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s it called), then you&#8217;re fundamentally stuck. The system actually features a more advanced &#8216;semantic&#8217; search, which essentially augments the scope of the keywords you put in via synonyms and related terms. That&#8217;s nice, but that&#8217;s also no substitute for a good old days yellow-pages-like categories browser. You know, just to get the hang of what&#8217;s in the box before opening it.</li>
<li><strong>You can&#8217;t <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>download</span> the data</strong>. To be fair, the FAQs clearly state that this feature is still being worked on. Fine &#8211; I guess they&#8217;re talking about some nifty mechanism to select-collect-&#038;-download specific datasets one is interested in. However I do wonder why one cannot download the entire dataset already.  At the end of the day, that data is <strong>A)</strong> already made available via the current user interface; <strong>B)</strong> public and (in theory) already available on a different website called <a href="https://www.siope.it/opendata/siopeopendata.htm">SIOPE</a> (available is a big word though &#8211; I should probably say <a href="http://blog.openpolis.it/2014/06/06/opensiope-cogliamo-unopportunita-non-puo-essere-sprecata/">buried</a>).</li>
<li><strong>The visualisation app is nice but very <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>limited</span></strong>. Data doesn&#8217;t become information unless you give it some meaningful context. This tool is a great idea but it&#8217;d be enormously more useful if you could decide yourself what to plot on the graph (e.g. which years, of which data sets) depending on your research questions i.e. your context. Moreover, you want to be able to make comparisons between different datasets etc etc.. All things that <a href="http://www.openbilanci.it/confronti/milano-comune-mi/napoli-comune-na/entrate/consuntivo-entrate-cassa-imposte-e-tasse">Open Bilanci does already pretty well</a>.</li>
<li><strong>There&#8217;s no data about the <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>beneficiaries</span> of the public expenses</strong>. Not sure what the challenges are here, or whether this is feasible at all. But it&#8217;d be great to have this extra piece of information, for transparency&#8217;s sake. For example, on spendnetwork.com you can easily see which are the list of <a href="https://spendnetwork.com/entity_spend/E5036_ELBC_gov">suppliers for the London Borough Council of Ealing expenses</a>.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion: how serious do you want to be about open data? </h3>
<p>This is an inspiring start and I can&#8217;t wait to see it being developed further. Especially if it gets developed with real end-users in mind!<br />
To that end, it&#8217;s useful to bring up what the OKFN has declared to be the key features of <a href="https://okfn.org/opendata/">data openness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<li><strong>Availability and access</strong>: the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.</li>
<li><strong>Reuse and redistribution</strong>: the data must be provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets. The data must be machine-readable.
</li>
<li><strong>Universal participation</strong>: everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute — there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.</li>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#8217;t stress strongly enough how useful it&#8217;d be being able to access the <strong>raw data</strong>. Excel, CSV, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a> or even better a <a href="http://linkeddata.org/guides-and-tutorials">Linked Data API</a>.<br />
A data-level access point would turn this nice-looking but essentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo">siloed website</a> into an open resource which thousands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism">data journalists</a> or data scientists (of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/">any kind</a>) could build upon.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to see this happen? I do!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no news that thousands of italian researchers left their home-country in order to be able to carry on doing what they like; the news though is that now we&#8217;re got also a scientific study shedding some light on the phenomena. It&#8217;s been done by the <a href="http://www.topitalianscientists.org">Via Academy</a>, an association dedicated to the creation of statistical analyses of the research outputs of italians (which are published on the <a href="http://www.tisreports.com/online_publication_platform_on_the_side_of_researchers.aspx">TIS reports website</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Clearly, the high impact of scientists who are now abroad bears testament to the quality of the Italian education and attitude when it comes to Computer Science. The inevitable question thus arises: why are Computer Scientists who work in Italy not among the top in either the world ranking or the TIS list? I have been asking this question to various colleagues in the field, both inside and outside the Via-academy network. The consistent answer I have been receiving is that there is a clear disadvantage Computer Scientists must face when working in Italy with respect to their colleagues who work abroad. This disadvantage derives from a mixture of excessive teaching duties, a lack of large-scale funding and a limited recognition of scientific merit</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent reports include the &#8220;<a href="http://www.tisreports.com/fullreport/1-Top_100_-_home___abroad.aspx">Top 100 researchers- home &#038; abroad</a>&#8221; (which includes the quotation above) and the &#8220;<a href="http://www.tisreports.com/products/4-Top_50_Italian_Institutes.aspx">Top 50 Italian Institutes</a>&#8220;.  </p>
<h3>The H-method: a first step towards meritocracy</h3>
<p>This type of analyses are mainly based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">H-index method</a> (an index that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or scholar); it therefore suffers from various <strong>limitations</strong> deriving from factors such as the difference in average number of publications among disciplines (especially, between science and the humanities), or from the fact that it&#8217;s a purely quantitative analysis. </p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, it seems to me as being an important step in the right direction: <a href="http://italyglobal.wordpress.com/2010/04/27/meritocracy-in-italy-its-needed/">meritocracy</a>.</p>
<p>p.s.<br />
I found out there&#8217;s a recent article by Ignazio Marino on the topic [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5881/1289.1.citation">Working Toward Meritocracy in Italy, Ignazio R. Marino, Science 6 June 2008: 1289</a>]; I couldn&#8217;t download it but here&#8217;s a short commentary on it I could find online:</p>

In short, a dictatorship-worthy <strong>blackmailing proposal</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some say that Italy&#8217;s ruling class is just struggling to keep pace with the Internet revolution. &#8220;<strong>Italy&#8217;s political culture is far removed from new technology</strong>,&#8221; says Luca Conti, 34, a blogger in the coastal city of Senigallia. &#8220;They&#8217;re not even focused yet on how to control the Internet since they haven&#8217;t even figured out how to use it to their advantage.&#8221; Case in point: more than 100,000 people attended an anti-Berlusconi rally in Rome last month that was organized on Facebook, but the top opposition politicians snubbed the event. Conti says <strong>the country&#8217;s leaders — left, right and center — are still focused solely on reaching the public via TV and newspapers. And unlike the Internet, the movers and shakers of the old media are some very familiar faces</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>What can I say? It&#8217;s disgusting &#8211; just spread the word and don&#8217;t let this people walk on your turf. Knowledge is power.</p>

I wish stuff like that would be happening in Italy too (as the overspending situation is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7961849.stm">quite more dramatic..</a>)<br />

<p>From the latest post on<a href="http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/2009/12/political_press_release_number_19.html"> Beppe Grillo&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are living through an unequalable historical phase. The <strong>worst of the Italian State</strong>. Berlusconi is the worst President of the Council of the last 150 years. Napolitano is the worst President of the Republic (a true “outsider” that makes one miss even Giovanni Leone who was kicked out). The PDminusL is the worst Opposition since the start of the existence of Parliament with Bersani as major-domo to D&#8217;Alema, the most intelligent and f**ked politician but also f**king, of the Republic. I want to be optimistic.<strong> We are at the bottom of the well and we can stop digging. We have got to the other side.</strong> I feel like an Italian towards the end of the second world war under the bombs. He knows it cannot go on for long. That the sky will once more be pale blue and that he will be able to go out into the street, happy as a child, and kiss the first stranger. My optimism is reasoned. The State has gone bust, <strong>a billion a day in Public Debt</strong> Is insuperable even for “Tremorti”. Millions of people have lost their job. The fund for those who are laid off is close to collapse. Parliament does not exist. It has been expropriated by Constitutional delinquents. The Church is in command. The camorra is in command. The &#8216;ndrangheta is in command. The citizen counts for nothing.<strong> Everything is lost and above all honour. Italian and clown are synonyms throughout the world.</strong> &#8220;Italian fucking clown&#8221;. The Council of Ministers is a continual replay of &#8220;Oggi le comiche&#8221; {Today the comics}. Any prostitute, any idiot could become Minister in Italy. This regime, like fascism in its time, can no longer be saved by anyone. It has shattered together with the dishonesty and the indifference of many Italians in the last few years. It’s like, after a tragedy, you pick yourself up out of necessity, that’s how it will happen in the near future. The <strong>Five Star Movement has no connections with the past,</strong> with none of the rotten names of corruption that govern us. The Movement<strong> is starting from zero</strong>, from the bottom, this is its strength. The Movement will present itself for the regional elections in Emilia Romagna, Campania, Veneto and Piedmont, with Davide Bono heading the list. Many 5 Star Lists are in preparation for the local elections. The Statute is nearly ready as is online registration. On 5 December I am supporting “No B-day”. I will not be on the stage and I will not speak as that has been requested by the organisers. “For us he is a politician and thus will not speak” is the decision of the promoting committee. We are living through social and institutional ruin that no one would have believed possible, starting with me. We are still in the basement, from the TV stations arrive voices of a present that is already past, of people like Schifani, Gasparri, Dell&#8217;Utri, Casini. So present and yet already far off. They will never give up (but is it in their interests?). Neither will we.</p></blockquote>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
By the way, Beppe Grillo is doing a gig in <a href="http://www.getmein.com/tickets/beppe-grillo-tickets/london-142971.html">London on Wednesday, 27 January 2010</a>. Sounds interesting?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.worldpressfreedomday.org/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132" title="picture-1" src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-1.png" alt="picture-1" width="453" height="403" srcset="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-1.png 511w, http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-1-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></a></p>
<p>An interesting study recently issued by the <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=1">Freedom House</a> (a non profit organization inspired by the ideals of democracy and freedom) positions Italy and another couple of unlucky countries at the bottom of the ladder. Well, kind of &#8211; we could say half-way up the ladder &#8211; but still quite alarmingly.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=811">New Study: Global Press Freedom Declines in Every Region for First Time Israel, Italy and Hong Kong Lose Free</a>. </strong>I report just a couple of passages&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Status</strong><strong>Western Europe</strong>: The region continues to boast the world&#8217;s highest level of press freedom. However, Italy slipped back into the Partly Free category with free speech limited by courts and libel laws, increased intimidation of journalists by organized crime and far-right groups, and concerns over the concentration of media ownership. Greece also suffered a significant decline.</p>
<p><strong>Fragile Freedoms</strong>: Declines in Israel, Italy and Taiwan illustrate that established democracies with traditionally open media are not immune to restricting media freedom. Over the last five years, a number of emerging democracies have also suffered considerable declines in press freedom including: Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Thailand, the Philippines and Senegal.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other related thing that came up to my mind, and that people outside Italy (but not only) often ignore, is that the italian government a few years back attempted to PUT A BRAKE ON THE INTERNET REVOLUTION, BY <strong>WANTING TO CHARGE BLOGGERS</strong>. I know it sounds <em>amazingly</em> incredible, especially because it&#8217;s coming from a country which is part of the G8 (supposedly, the bunch of guys who&#8217;re &#8216;leading&#8217; &#8211; whatever that means). This piece of news was <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article2732802.ece">covered by the times online some time ago</a> &#8211; here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, Italian lawmakers once again took aim at modern life, introducing an  incredibly broad law that would effectively require all bloggers, and even  users of social networks, to register with the state. Even a harmless blog  about a favourite football squad or a teenager grousing about life’s  unfairness would be subject to government oversight, and even taxation –  even if it’s not a commercial website.</p>
<p>Outside Italy, the legislation has generated sniggers from hardly sympathetic  industry observers. <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/22/italy-proposes-a-min.html">Boingboing</a> cleverly reports Italy is proposing a “Ministry of Blogging.” <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-8570">Out-law.com</a> plays it straighter, calling the measure an “anti-blogger” law.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I&#8217;ll start using this mostly technical blog to help in spreading the word about the incredible political situation in italy. What I&#8217;m talking about? You can probably catch up on the latest from corrupted Italy by reading <a href="http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/">Beppe Grillo&#8217;s blog</a>&#8230;.. it&#8217;s good for a laugh too, if you dont feel like talking about politics.</p>
<p>Anyways &#8211; the most recent one is the supreme selection of candidates the italian parties are sending to Bruxelles for the EU parliament. <a href="http://www.voglioscendere.ilcannocchiale.it/">Travaglio</a> docet:</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KAppZDz7c8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>If you&#8217;re not lucky enough to understand italian, there&#8217;s a nice <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6150318.ece">article by The Times about it</a>, titled &#8216;<strong>The beauty of democracy as Silvio Berlusconi picks model MEP candidates</strong>&#8216;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Silvio Berlusconi has an eye for pretty girls with a background in showbusiness and has brought some of them into parliament and even his Cabinet to brighten up politics.</p>
<p>Even by his standards, though, Mr Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, has chosen a striking roster of candidates to give his party a new face for the European Parliament elections in June, including a <em>Big Brother</em> star and a Miss Italy contestant.</p>
<p>None has any known political experience although Angela Sozio, 36, a flame-haired former contestant of <em>Grande Fratello</em>, the Italian version of <em>Big Brother,</em> made the headlines two years ago when the paparazzi photographed her and other showgirls strolling hand-in-hand with Mr Berlusconi, 72, at Villa Certosa, his villa in Sardinia.</p>
<p>The photographs, which appeared in the mass circulation magazine <em>Oggi</em> under the headline “Berlusconi’s Harem”, showed some of the women sitting on the Prime Minister’s knee. He insisted that he was being hospitable in showing the women round his seaside estate while his wife, the former actress Veronica Lario, was at her villa near Milan [&#8230;&#8230;.continues&#8230;.]</p></blockquote>
