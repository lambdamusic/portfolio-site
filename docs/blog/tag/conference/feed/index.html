								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I attended the <a href="http://2016.semantics.cc/">Semantics</a> conference in Leipzig, so here&#8217;s a short report about the event.</p>
<blockquote><p>SEMANTiCS 2016 (<a href="https://twitter.com/semanticsconf">#semanticsconf</a>) continues a long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world to present best practices, panels, papers and posters to discuss semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal settings.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I really liked about this event is the fact that it is primarily industry-focused, meaning that most (if not all) of the talks were dealing with pragmatic aspects of real-world applications of semantic technologies. You can take a look at the <a href="https://2016.semantics.cc/proceedings">online proceedings</a> for more details, alternatively there are some nice <a href="https://2016.semantics.cc/voices">videos</a> and <a href="https://2016.semantics.cc/pictures">pictures</a> pages too.</p>
<p>I meant to share some notes a few weeks ago already but never got round to doing it… so here are a few highlights:</p>
<li><strong>Springer Nature&#8217;s</strong> <a href="http://www.springernature.com/scigraph">Scigraph</a> project got quite a bit of publicity as I was one of the invited <strong>keynote speakers</strong>. Overall, the feedback was extremely <strong>positive</strong> and it seems that many people are waiting to see more from us in the coming months. We also chatted to representatives from other publishers (Elsevier, Wolfer Kluwers, Oxford Uni Press) about areas where we could collaborate more e.g. constructing shared datasets (eg conference identifiers, coordinated by CrossRef the same way they do it for <a href="https://www.crossref.org/fundingdata/">Funders</a>).</li>
<p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/qMrblWCSHtqOcL" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><a href="https://2016.semantics.cc/cathy-dolbear">Cathy Dolbear</a> from <strong>Oxford University Press</strong> gave an interesting keynote describing the work they’ve been doing with Linked Data, mostly focusing on the <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ogl">Oxford Global Languages project</a>, which links lexical information from multiple global and also digitally under-represented  languages in a semantic graph.  Also, she talked about <strong>creating rich schema.org snippets so to better interface with Google’s knowledge graph</strong> and thus increasing their ranking in search results. That was really good to hear as we&#8217;re investing in this area too! </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><a href="https://2016.semantics.cc/david-kuilman-0">David Kuilman</a> from <strong>Elsevier</strong> talked about their approach to content management based on semantic technologies. David&#8217;s team has been focusing on <strong>tracking document production metadata</strong> mainly <strong>before publication</strong> (eg submission and production workflow metadata) which is quite interesting cause it’s the exact opposite of what we’ve been doing at Springer Nature.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 1st we were invited to present the <a href="http://www.scigraph.com/">Scigraph</a> project at the <a href="http://theodi.org/summit/2016">London ODI Summit</a>, the annual event organized by the <a href="http://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a> to review and discuss the social and economic impact of open data in both the public and commercial sectors.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7579.jpg"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7579.jpg"  alt="IMG 7579" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>If data infrastructure is as important to our infrastructure as roads, then the <a href="http://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a> is helping to lay the concrete. Join us on 1 November to hear inspiring stories from around the world on how people are innovating with the web of data, with presentations from diverse innovators – from startups to high-profile speakers such as Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (creator of the World Wide Web), Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Shadbolt">Nigel Shadbolt</a> (AI expert) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Lane_Fox">Martha Lane Fox</a> (Lastminute.com founder).</p></blockquote>
<p>Our presentation was part of a a session titled <strong>How to design for open government and enterprise</strong>, which included two speakers from industry (me and <a href="http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/tharindi-hapuarachchi">Tharindi Hapuarachchi</a> from Thomson Reuters Labs) and two from the public sector (<a href="http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/clare-moriarty">Clare Moriarty</a> from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and <a href="https://traffordinnovationlab.wordpress.com/author/ciljamie/">Jamie Whyte</a> from Trafford Council). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7590.jpg"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7590.jpg"  alt="IMG 7590" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feedback was very positive, in particular the audience seem to have liked the long standing commitment Springer Nature towards making science more open. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ScreenShot2016-11-21at11.29.14.png"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ScreenShot2016-11-21at11.29.14.png"  alt="Screen+Shot+2016 11 21+at+11 29 14" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other bits and pieces:</p>
<li>the <a href="http://theodi.org/news/open-data-awards-2016-shortlists-announced">open data awards</a> from this year include various interesting projects and are worth taking a look at;</li>
<li><strong>Tim Berners Lee</strong> hinting at the potential of recent technical advances like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)">blockchain technology</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/solid/">Solid</a> project;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://opendataincubator.eu/">ODINE</a> (Open Data Incubator Europe) session was very interesting, in fact I&#8217;ve learnt that there&#8217;s a <a href="https://thingful.net/">search engine for the internet of things</a> too!</li>
<p>Finally, some more pictures..</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I attended the <a href="https://www.force11.org/">https://www.force11.org/</a> conference in Oxford the last couple of days (the conference was previously called &#8216;Beyond the PDF&#8217;).</p>
<blockquote><p>Force11 is a community of scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers and research funders that has arisen organically to help facilitate the change toward improved knowledge creation and sharing. Individually and collectively, we aim to bring about a change in modern scholarly communications through the effective use of information technology. [<a href="https://www.force11.org/about">About Force 11</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than the presentations, I would say that the most valuable aspect of this event are the many <strong>conversations</strong> you can have with people from different backgrounds: techies, publishers, policy makers, academics etc..</p>
<p>Nonetheless, here&#8217;s a (very short and biased) list of things that seemed to stand out.</p>
<li>A talk titled <em><strong>Who&#8217;s Sharing with Who? Acknowledgements-driven identification of resources</strong></em> by <a href="https://www.icts.uiowa.edu/Loki/research/browseResearch.jsp?browse=E&#038;id=950712">David Eichmann</a>, University of Iowa. He is working on a (seemingly very effective) method for extracting contributors roles from scientific articles </li>
<blockquote><p>This presentation describes my recent work in semantic analysis of the acknowledgement section of biomedical research articles, specifically the sharing of resources (instruments, reagents, model organisms, etc.) between the author articles and other non-author investigators.  The resulting semantic graph complements the knowledge currently captured by research profiling systems, which primarily focus on investigators, publications and grants.  My approach results in much finer-grained information, at the individual author contribution level, and the specific resources shared by external parties.  The long-term goal for this work is unification with the VIVO-ISF-based CTSAsearch federated search engine, which currently contains research profiles from 60 institutions worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>A talk titled <em><strong>Why are we so attached to attachments? Let&#8217;s ditch them and improve publishing</strong></em> by Kaveh Bazargan, head of <a href="http://rivervalleytechnologies.com/">River Valley Technologies</a>. He demoed a <a href="http://rivervalleytechnologies.com/river-valley-technologies-launch-automated-xml-publishing/#more-179">prototype manuscript tracking system</a> that allows editors, authors and reviewers to create new versions of the same document via an online google-doc-like system which has JATS XML in the background</li>
<blockquote><p>I argue that it is precisely the ubiquitous use of attachments that has held up progress in publishing. We have the technology right now to allow the author to write online and have the file saved automatically as XML. All subsequent work on the &#8220;manuscript&#8221; (e.g. copy editing, QC, etc) can also be done online. At the end of the process the XML is automatically &#8220;rendered&#8221; to PDF, Epub, etc, and delivered to the end user, on demand. This system is quicker as there are no emails or attachments to hold it up, cheaper as there is no admin involved, and more accurate as there is only one definitive file (the XML) which is the &#8220;format of record&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><a href="http://blog.f1000.com/author/rebecca-lawrence/">Rebecca Lawrence</a> from <a href="http://f1000.com/">F1000</a> presented and gave me a walk through of a <a href="http://f1000.com/beta/">new suite of tools they&#8217;re working on</a>. That was quite impressing I must say, especially due to the variety of features they offer: tools to organize and store references, annotate and discuss articles and web pages, import them into word documents etc.. All packed within a nicely looking and user friendly application. This is due to go public beta some time in March, but you can try to get access to it sooner by signing up <a href="http://f1000.com/beta/">here</a>.</li>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-17-at-18.18.18.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-17-at-18.18.18.png"  alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 17 at 18 18 18" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>The best <strong>poster</strong> award went to <em><strong>101 Innovations in Scholarly Communication &#8211; the Changing Research Workflow</strong></em>. This is a project aiming to chart innovation in scholarly information and communication flows. Very inspiring and definitely <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/101_Innovations_in_Scholarly_Communication_the_Changing_Research_Workflow/1286826">worth a look</a>.</li>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-11.49.58-AM.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-11.49.58-AM.png"  alt="Screen+Shot+2015 01 15+at+11 49 58+AM" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a> </p>
<li>Finally, I&#8217;m proud to say that the best <strong>demo</strong> award went to my own <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">resquotes.com</a>, a personal quotations-manager online tool which I&#8217;ve just <a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/2015/01/05/introducing-resquotes-com/">launched</a> a couple of weeks ago. Needless to say, it was great to get vote of confidence from this community!</li>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-08.48.30.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-08.48.30.png"  alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 06 at 08 48 30" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want more, it&#8217;s worth taking a look directly at the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/detailed-agenda">conference agenda</a> and in particular the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/demos-and-posters">demo/poster session</a> agenda. And hopefully see you next year in Portland, Oregon :-)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m posting here a short summary of the paper I&#8217;ve given at the last International Semantic Web conference in Riva del Garda (<a href="http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org/">ISWC14</a>) together with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyhammond">Tony Hammond</a>. </p>
<p>The presentation focused on an hybrid data architecture (<strong>XML</strong> for <strong>storage</strong>&#038;<strong>querying</strong>, <strong>RDF</strong> for <strong>modeling</strong>&#038;<strong>integration</strong>) which emerged as the most practical solution during the process of re-engineering of the publishing platform which has occurred within our company (<a href="http://se.macmillan.com/">Macmillan S&#038;E</a>) in the last years. </p>
<p>This is the abstract: </p>
<blockquote><p>This paper presents recent work carried out at Macmillan Science and Education in evolving a traditional XML-based, document- centric enterprise publishing platform into a scalable, thing-centric and RDF-based semantic architecture. <strong>Performance</strong> and <strong>robustness</strong> guarantees required by our online products on the one hand, and the need to support <strong>legacy architectures</strong> on the other, led us to develop a hybrid infrastructure in which the data is modelled throughout in RDF but is replicated and distributed between RDF and XML data stores for efficient retrieval. A recently launched product – dynamic pages for scientific subject terms – is briefly introduced as a result of this semantic publishing architecture.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/papers/47/">paper is available online</a>; slides from the presentation can be found below. </p>
<p>The <strong>ISWC industry track</strong> was packed with interesting papers so I think it&#8217;s worth taking a look at the <a href="https://dkm-static.fbk.eu/resources/iswc2014/proceedings/ISWC2014IndustryTrack-Extended%E2%80%93Abstracts.pdf">online proceedings</a>. The uptake of tech outside academia is always revealing of the many real-world difficulties involved in making something fit within pre-existing work practices and legacy technologies. This is especially true of larger companies, where investment in older technologies (and in people who know about them) can be considerable, hence upgrades are costly and need to be evaluated more carefully. </p>
<p>This is the sort of background that led me and my colleagues at MacMillan to opt for a hybrid solution that combines the power of an established <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/what-is-marklogic/enterprise-nosql/">enterprise MarkLogic</a> installation with more cutting edge data integration approaches based on RDF. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hybrydXMLRDF.png"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hybrydXMLRDF.png" alt="HybrydXMLRDF" style="float:middle; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;  width: 400px;" border="0" width="400"  /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/subjects">Nature.com subject pages</a> were one of the first products built on top of this architecture. And many more will come: we&#8217;re still heavily involved in this work though, so stay tuned for more stuff in this space. </p>
<p>Soon, we will also be releasing our public ontologies online and making available a new and improved version of the <a href="http://www.nature.com/developers/documentation/linked-data-platform/releases/">nature.com datasets</a>. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the European Semantic Web Conference (<a href="http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/">ESWC&#8217;13</a>) in Montpellier and had a really good time meeting old friends and catching up with the latest research in this area. In this post I&#8217;ll collect a few pointers to papers and ideas that caught my attention. </p>
<p>For a high level summary of the talks, you can check out the <a href="http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/ESWC2013_Programm_Web.pdf">pdf program</a>, the <a href="http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/program/workshops">workshops page</a> or the <a href="http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/program/tutorials">tutorials page</a>. </p>
<p>In particular the semantic publishing workshop <a href="http://sepublica.mywikipaper.org/drupal/node/25">SEPublica13</a> was very relevant for my current work, as its stated purpose is to discuss and review &#8220;<em>accessing and reusing the computable data that the literature represents and describes</em>&#8221; &#8211; something that all digital publishers are thinking about these days.  </p>
<p>As for the rest of the conference, here&#8217;s a more lengthy summary of (some of) the presentations I managed to attend, organised by topic. </p>
<h2>Keynote: less <em>semantics</em> and more <em>web</em></h2>
<p>The keynote from MIT&#8217;s <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger/">David Karger</a> was quite remarkable. In a talk titled “<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/haystack/blog/2013/06/05/keynote-at-the-european-semantic-web-conference-part-1-the-state-of-end-user-information-management/">The Semantic Web for End Users</a>” he challenged several widespread assumptions about the SW (maybe most intriguingly the &#8216;<em>if it&#8217;s using RDF/OWL then it&#8217;s SW</em>&#8216; principle). Karger argued for a a less AI-oriented, more user-centric and web-centric view of semantic web research, according to which one of the key opportunities for SW practitioners is to &#8220;<strong><em>make it easier for end users to produce, share, and consume structured data</em></strong>&#8220;, irrespectively of whether these are encoded in any of the RDF family of languages. Rather, SW tools should be measured  in terms of how much they allow people to deal effectively with &#8216;<strong><em>applications whose schema is expected to change</em></strong>&#8216;.<br />
In general, the semantic web (like the web) should not be making &#8216;new things possible&#8217; but rather &#8216;old things simpler&#8217;. </p>
<h2>Semantic Science</h2>
<blockquote><p>Gon, B., Porto, F., &#038; Moura, A. M. C.. <em>On the semantic engineering of scientific hypotheses as linked data</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper addresses the <strong>engineering of hypotheses as linked data</strong>, and builds upon the <a href="http://linkedscience.org/lsc/ns/">Linked Science Core vocabulary</a> by extending it in order allow the definition of scientific hypotheses as assumptions that constrain the interpretation of observed phenomena for computer simulation. A prototype application built by eliciting and linking hypotheses in a published research in Computational <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics">Hemodynamics</a> (the study of the human cardiovascular system) is discussed to illustrate the notion of &#8216;conceptual traceability&#8217; of research statements. </p>
<blockquote><p>Gil, Y., Ratnakar, V., &#038; Hanson, P. C.  <em>Organic Data Publishing : A Novel Approach to Scientific Data Sharing</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper introduces an approach called &#8216;<strong>organic data sharing</strong>&#8216; that 1) links dataset contributions directly to science questions, 2) reduces the burden of data sharing by enabling any scientist to contribute metadata, and 3) tracks and exposes credit for all contributors. An initial prototype that is built as an extension of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_wiki">semantic wiki</a>, can import Linked Data, and can publish as Linked Data any new content created by users.</p>
<blockquote><p>Zhao, J., &#038; Klyne, G. (2013). <em>How Reliable is Your workflow : Monitoring Decay in Scholarly Publications</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper addresses the notion of <a href="http://alpha.myexperiment.org/">workflow</a> &#8216;decay&#8217;. Increasingly, <strong>scientific workflows are being treated as first-class artifacts</strong>, for exchanging and transferring actual scholarly findings, either as part of scholarly articles or as stand-alone objects. However scientific workflows are commonly subject to a decayed or reduced ability to be executed or repeated, largely due to the volatility of the external resources that are required for their executions. Based on our this hypothesis, the authors present a minimal set of information to be associated in a workflow to reduce its decay and be effectively exchanged as a reproducible research object.</p>
<blockquote><p>Callahan, A., Cruz-toledo, J., Ansell, P., &#038; Dumontier, M. (2013). <em>Bio2RDF Release 2 : Improved coverage , interoperability and provenance of Life Science Linked Data</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bio2rdf.org/">Bio2RDF</a> is an open-source project that provides <strong>linked data for the life sciences</strong> using Semantic Web technologies. Bio2RDF scripts (available on <a href="https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-scripts">github</a>) convert heterogeneously formatted data (e.g. flat-files, tab-delimited files, dataset specific formats, SQL, XML etc.) into a common format, RDF. The paper describes the new features of the latest Bio2RDF release, which provides a federated network of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bio2rdf/index.php?title=SPARQL_endpoints">SPARQL endpoints</a> over 19 datasets. Other new features include provenance information via <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV</a>, mapping of dataset-specific vocabulary to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/semanticscience/wiki/SIO">Semanticscience Integrated Ontology</a> (SIO), context-sensitive SPARQL query formulation using <a href="http://sindicetech.com/sindice-suite/sparqled/">SparQLed</a> and a central registry of datasets in order to normalize generated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier">IRIs</a>. </p>
<h2>Semantic Publishing</h2>
<blockquote><p>T. Kuhn, P. E. Barbano, M. L. Nagy, and M. Krauthammer, <em>Broadening the Scope of Nanopublications</em>. </p></blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, <a href="http://nanopub.org/wordpress/">nanopublications</a> are described as an approach to (1) subdivide scientific results into minimal pieces, (2) to represent these results — called assertions — in an RDF-based formal notation, (3) to attach RDF-based provenance information on this “atomic” level, and (4) to treat each of these tiny entities as a separate publication. The authors of this paper challenge assumption (2) as unrealistic, essentially due to the proven difficulties in acquiring structured, logic-based assertions from people, and propose a new system (<a href="http://purl.org/nanobrowser">nanobrowser</a>) that allows authors and curators to <strong>attach English sentences to nanopublications</strong>, thus allowing for informal representations of scientific claims.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lord, P., &#038; Marshall, L. (2013). <em>Twenty-Five Shades of Greycite : Semantics for referencing and preservation</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper describes two new systems: <a href="http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org/">greycite</a> and <a href="http://knowledgeblog.org/kblog-metadata">kblog-metadata</a>. The former, addresses the <strong>problem of bibliographic metadata</strong>, without resorting to a single central authority, extracting this metadata directly from URI end-points. The latter provides more specialised support for generating appropriate metadata within the popular <strong>wordpress</strong> blogging platform. The underlying rationale for both systems, claims the author, is that semantic metadata must be of value to all participants in the publishing process, most importantly the authors. </p>
<blockquote><p>Mavergames, C., Oliver, S., &#038; Becker, L. (2013). <em>Systematic Reviews as an interface to the web of ( trial ) data : Using PICO as an ontology for knowledge synthesis in evidence-based healthcare research The Cochrane Collaboration</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The paper describes a prototype application that makes use of linked data technologies to <strong>improve discovery of information</strong> stored in the <a href="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/">Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</a>, a resource in the domain of healthcare research (in particular the area of evidence-based medicine). The approach described relies on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICO_process">PICO framework</a> (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) as an ontology to aid in better discoverability,  presentation, and synthesis of the knowledge available in the documents offered by the database. A prototype web application based on <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/semantic-web">Drupal&#8217;s SW module</a> is presented. </p>
<blockquote><p>Wiljes, C., Jahn, N., Lier, F., Paul-stueve, T., Vompras, J., Pietsch, C., &#038; Cimiano, P. (2013). <em>Towards Linked Research Data : An Institutional Approach. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The paper describes an infrastructure used that <strong>enables researchers to manage their publications</strong> and the underlying research data in an easy and efficient way within a academic institution, Bielefeld University and the associated <a href="https://www.cit-ec.de/">Center of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology</a>. The platform created follows a Linked Data approach and uses <a href="http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/">Virtuoso</a> to store data sources from inside the university and outside sources like DBpedia.</p>
<h2>NLP, knowledge extraction </h2>
<blockquote><p>Iorio, A. Di, Nuzzolese, A. G., &#038; Peroni, S. (2013). <em>Towards the automatic identification of the nature of citations.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The paper presents an algorithm, called <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it:8080/tools/citalo">CiTalO</a>, to <strong>infer automatically the function of citations</strong> by means of Semantic Web technologies and NLP techniques. CiTalO infers the function of citations by combining techniques of ontology learning from natural language, sentiment-analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and ontology mapping. These techniques are applied in a pipeline whose input is the textual context containing the citation and the output is a one or more properties of the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito">CiTO</a> ontology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jael, L., Castro, G., Berlanga, R., Rebholz-schuhmann, D., &#038; Garcia, A. (2013). <em>Connections across scientific publications based on semantic annotations. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The paper presents an experiment aimed at <strong>evaluating different concept annotation solutions</strong> on full text documents to determine to which extend relatedness can be inferred from such annotations. Eleven full-text articles from the open-access subset of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> have been extracted and annotated semantically using <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/">MeSH</a>, <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/">UMLS</a>, and other ontologies. The authors show that connections across articles from annotations automatically identified with entity recognition tools, e.g., <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/">Whatizit</a>, <a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator">NCBO Annotator</a>, and CMA, are similar to those connections exhibit based on the PubMed MeSH terms, thus validating their approach. </p>
<blockquote><p>A. Gangemi, <em>A Comparison of Knowledge Extraction Tools for the Semantic Web</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article <strong>reviews a number of Natural Language Processing tools</strong> (for various purposes, such as name-entity recognition or word sense disambiguation) that have been configured for Semantic Web tasks including ontology learning, linked data population, entity resolution, NL querying to linked data and others. The tools have been compared using a sample  taken from an online article of The New York Times and the results are <a href="http://stlab.istc.cnr.it/stlab/KnowledgeExtractionToolEval">available online</a>. The tools  reviewed are: <a href="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/aida/">AIDA</a>, <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/demo.html">AlchemyAPI</a>, <a href="http://dev.iks-project.eu:8081/enhancer">Apache Stanbol</a>, <a href="http://dbpedia-spotlight.github.com/demo">DBpedia Spotlight</a>, <a href="http://demo.languagecomputer.com/cicerolite">CiceroLite</a>, <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/FOX.html">FOX</a>, <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred">FRED</a>, <a href="http://nerd.eurecom.fr">NERD</a>, <a href="http://viewer.opencalais.com/">Open Calais</a>, <a href="http://poolparty.biz/demozone/general">PoolParty Knowledge Discoverer</a>, <a href="http://reverb.cs.washington.edu">ReVerb</a>, <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/wikifier">Semiosearch Wikifier</a>, <a href="http://www.wikimeta.com/wapi/semtag.pl">Wikimeta</a>, <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/demo/">Zemanta</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>E. Cabrio, S. Villata, F. Gandon, and I. S. Antipolis, <em>A Support Framework for Argumentative Discussions Management in the Web</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper presents an approach based on NLP for automatically <strong>extracting argumentative relationships from highly active wiki pages</strong>. The overall purpose is to support community managers in managing the discussions and have an overall view of the ongoing deabtes so to detect the winning arguments. Argumentative discussions are formalized using an extension of the <a href="http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/">SIOC Argumentation vocabulary</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>O. Medelyan, S. Manion, J. Broekstra, A. Divoli, A. Huang, and I. H. Witten, <em>Constructing a Focused Taxonomy from a Document Collection</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The paper describes a new method for <strong>constructing custom taxonomies from document collections</strong>, called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/focusedtaxonomies/">F-STEP</a>. It involves identifying relevant concepts and entities in text; linking them to knowledge sources like Wikipedia, <a href="http://dbpedia.org/About">DBpedia</a>, <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a>, and any supplied taxonomies from related domains; disambiguating conflicting concept mappings; and selecting semantic relations that best group them hierarchically. By using this approach the authors constructed a custom taxonomy with 10,000 concepts and 12,700 relations from 2000 news articles. An evaluation with human judges has shows high rates of precision (90%) and recall (75%). </p>
<h2>SW tech in real world systems</h2>
<blockquote><p>P. Szekely, C. A. Knoblock, F. Yang, X. Zhu, E. E. Fink, R. Allen, and G. Goodlander, <em>Connecting the Smithsonian American Art Museum to the Linked Data Cloud</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This paper describes the process and lessons learned in <strong>publishing the data from the</strong> <a href="http://americanart.si.edu/">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a>. The paper contains detailed descriptions of a) how relational data have been mapped to RDF (a system called <a href="http://www.isi.edu/integration/karma/">Karma</a> was used), b) how links to other linked data URIs have been created, and c) the process of curation to ensure that both the published information and its links to other sources within the LOD are accurate.  The dataset uses an extended version of the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/">Europeana Data Model</a>, which is the metamodel used in the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/">Europeana project</a> to represent data from Europe’s cultural heritage institutions, plus other standards like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>L. M. Garshol and A. Borge, <em>Hafslund Sesam – an archive on semantics</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper describes an architecture based on RDF and Virtuoso, constructed to facilitate data integration and reuse within <a href="http://www.hafslund.no/">Hafslund</a>, a <strong>Norwegian energy company</strong>. Documents are tagged with URIs from the triple store, and these URIs connect the document metadata with enterprise data extracted from backend systems. All source systems are integrated using a custom-built client-server solution based on <a href="http://www.sdshare.org/">SDShare</a>  &#8211;  a specification for synchronizing RDF data using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom feeds</a>.</p>
<h2>Random notes</h2>
<li><a href="http://sindicetech.com/sindice-suite/sparqled/">SparQLed</a> is an open source app that gives you an interactive SPARQL editor with context-aware recommendations (via autocompletion and other tricks). Definitely worth taking a look at.</li>
<li>I missed the excellent <a href="http://www.labf.usb.ve/TUTORIAL2013/ESWC2013Tutorial/Home.html">Semantic Data Management Techniques in<br />
Graph Databases</a> tutorial, but luckily the <a href="http://www.labf.usb.ve/TUTORIAL2013/ESWC2013Tutorial/Home_files/SlidesTutorialGraphDatabases_MAC.pdf">slides are available online</a>. If you&#8217;re interested in graph databases, check them out, they include a detailed <strong>analysis and comparison of various graph databases</strong> including Neo4j, Hypergraph and many others.</li>
<li>David Karger pointed out a web app called <a href="https://ifttt.com">If THis Then That</a>. Rule-based reasoning on the web, without any fancy AI. Pretty cool!</li>
<li><a href="http://identifiers.org/">identifiers.org/</a> is yet another service that aims at providing resolvable persistent URIs used to identify data for the scientific community</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I went to the <a href="http://caaconference.org/">CAA 2012</a> conference in Southampton, one of the top conferences in the world in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_archaeology">computational archaeology</a>. I couldn&#8217;t stay for longer than a day, but I&#8217;ve seen enough to say that archaeologist definitely know their way around when it comes to combining IT with their discipline. </p>
<p>I presented a poster about the <a href="http://www.artofmaking.ac.uk/">Art of Making project</a> (which deals with categorising and making available online a collection of images of ancient Roman sculpture). In particular I was there for the <strong>Data Modelling and Sharing</strong> session: the formal ontology we&#8217;re working on in the Art of Making (and the accompanying dataset) is likely going to become one of the first in its kind. So I was quite interested in finding out who&#8217;s doing what, when it comes to sharing data about the the ancient world. </p>
<p>The answer is, there are a lot of people doing very interesting things (btw please get in touch if you know of other relatable datasets). Here&#8217;re a brief report on some the papers that struck me (for the full list of the talks I would have liked to attend, check out <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/mpasin">my interactive schedule</a>.)</p>
<li>A <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/b8dba5f531a7d2c41faebf303865357e">paper on the Pelagios project</a> by Leif Isaksen. Pelagios is a consortium that <strong>brings together</strong> an impressive number of other <strong>datasets</strong> on the ancient world. I&#8217;d say each of them is worth taking a look at: <a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/">Arachne</a>; <a href="http://explore.clarosnet.org/XDB/ASP/clarosHome/">CLAROS</a>; <a href="http://www.fastionline.org/">Fasti Online</a>; <a href="http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/">Google Ancient Places</a>; <a href="http://nomisma.org/">Nomisma</a>; <a href="http://opencontext.org/">Open Context</a>; <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">Perseus</a>; <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>; <a href="http://ptolemymachine.appspot.com/">Ptolemy Machine</a>, <a href="http://spqr.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/">SPQR</a>; <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/Ure/index.php">Ure museum</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/5cbf48abc47a735213ea2f95e5b55fce">paper titled &#8220;When, What, Where, How and Who?&#8221;</a> by Sarah May. She reported about a <strong>user-study aimed at understanding how archeologist search for information online</strong>, and whether an more integrated web of data would match their current information seeking behaviours. </li>
<li>The paper &#8220;<a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/efe75fbdd784b8c73d0938e4591af1b0">Exploring Semantic Web-based research questions for the spatio-temporal relationships at Çatalhöyük</a>&#8220;, by <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/research/research-students/holly-wright/">Holly Wright</a>. She presented an archeological data-modeling scenario that calls for <strong>more powerful knowledge representation approaches to time and events</strong>. There are two broad approaches to solve this problem, she said: <strong>temporal reification</strong> (apparently this is mostly done using SWRL rules, e.g. <a href="http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/events/swap2010/paper-04.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCoQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbmir.stanford.edu%2Ffile_asset%2Findex.php%2F1534%2FBMIR-2010-1414.pdf&#038;ei=9BZzT7WaFYfB0QWvn9T5Dw&#038;usg=AFQjCNFwmhf_HaJxEQMq1lI-hl-B8YpSww">here</a>) and <strong>temporal fluents</strong> (some info <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=sea&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=temporal+fluents">here</a>, and also in the context of the <a href="http://www.defeasible.org/ruleml2011ijcai/files/Batsakis.pdf">SOWL</a> project). I don&#8217;t know much on this topic, but surely this paper got me interested in it!</li>
<li>A paper presenting the <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/394231b4c4a4ad537ce3cf314e983fb2">SAWS</a> project, which looks at defining and <strong>linking related units of text in original manuscripts</strong> using semantic web technologies.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://data.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/page/">Archeology Data Services</a>, a York-based organisation that aims at &#8216;<strong>preserving digital data in the long term</strong>, and by promoting and disseminating a broad range of data in archaeology&#8217;. In particular one of their project, <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/research/stellar/">Stellar</a>, has produced a <a href="http://hypermedia.research.glam.ac.uk/resources/STELLAR-applications/">number of software tools</a> that facilitate the manipulation of archeological data and their transformation into rdf-compliant formats.    </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, this is the schedule for the whole conference (notice the slick widget &#8211; it&#8217;s powered by a new service <a href="http://sched.org/">sched.org</a>)  :</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The THATcamp Kansas and Digital Humanities Forum happened last week at the <a href="http://idrh.ku.edu/">Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities</a>, which is part of the <a href="http://www.ku.edu/">University of Kansas</a> in beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Kansas">Lawrence</a>. I had the opportunity to be there and give a talk about some recent stuff I&#8217;ve been working on regarding digital prosopography and computer ontologies, so in this blog post I&#8217;m summing up a bit the things that caught my attention while at the conference.</p>
<p>The event happened on September 22-24 and consistend of three separate things: </p>
<li>Bootcamp Workshops: a set of in-depth workshops on digital tools and other DH topics <a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/bootcamps/">http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/bootcamps/</a>.</li>
<li>THATCamp: an “unconference” for technologists and humanists <a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/">http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Representing Knowledge in the DH conference: a one-day program of panels and poster sessions (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&#038;key=0Ap2U716RmYD7dHdyR1RseWFvb0tOYzREZ1hpQWNUTkE&#038;hl=en_US&#038;gid=3">schedule</a> | <a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/category/representing-knowledge-conference/">abstracts</a> )</li>
<p>The workshop and THATcamp were both packed with interesting stuff, so I strongly suggest you take a look at the online documentation, which is very comprehensive. In what follows I&#8217;ll instead highlight some of the contributed papers which a) I liked and b) I was able to attend (needless to say, this list matches only my individual preference and interests). Hope you&#8217;ll find something of interest there too!</p>
<h2>A (quite subjective) list of interesting papers</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><strong>The Graphic Visualization of XML Documents</strong>, by <a href="http://clover.slavic.pitt.edu/~djb/">David Birnbaum</a> (<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/21/the-graphic-visualization-of-xml-documents/"> abstract </a>): a quite inspiring example of how to employ visualizations in order to support philological research in the humanities. Mostly focused on Russian texts and XML-oriented technologies, but its principles easily generalizable to other contexts and technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring Issues at the Intersection of Humanities and Computing with LADL</strong>, by <a href="http://www.gregoryaist.com/">Gregory Aist</a> (<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/20/exploring-issues-at-the-intersection-of-humanities-and-computing-with-ladl/"> abstract </a>): the talk presented LADL, the Learning Activity Description Language, a fascinating software environment provides a way to &#8220;describe both the information structure and the interaction structure of an interactive experience&#8221;, to the purpose of &#8220;constructing a single interactive Web page that allows for viewing and comparing of multiple source documents together with online tools&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong>Making the most of free, unrestricted texts–a first look at the promise of the Text Creation Partnership</strong>, by <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rwelzenb/">Rebecca Welzenbach</a> (<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/21/making-the-most-of-free-unrestricted-texts-a-first-look-at-the-promise-of-the-text-creation-partnership/"> abstract </a>): an interesting report on the pros and cons of making available a large repository of SGML/XML encoded texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (<a href="http://gale.cengage.co.uk/product-highlights/history/eighteenth-century-collections-online.aspx">ECCO</a>) corpus.</li>
<li><strong>The hermeneutics of data representation</strong>, by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/cmsmcq/">Michael Sperberg-McQueen</a> (<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/21/the-hermeneutics-of-data-representation/"> abstract </a>): a speculative and challenging investigation of the assumptions at the root of any machine-readable representation of knowledge &#8211; and their cultural implications.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking the Historian’s Code: Finding Patterns of Historical Representation</strong>, by <a href="http://aeshin.org/">Ryan Shaw</a> (<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/21/breaking-the-historian%E2%80%99s-code-finding-patterns-of-historical-representation/"> abstract </a>): an investigation on the usage of natural language processing techniques to the purpose of &#8216;breaking down&#8217; the &#8216;code&#8217; of historical narrative. In particular, the sets of documents used are related to the civil rights movement, and the specific NLP techniques being employed are named entity recognition, event extraction, and event chain mining.</li>
<li><strong>Employing Geospatial Genealogy to Reveal Residential and Kinship Patterns in a Pre-Holocaust Ukrainian Village</strong>, by <a href="http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Egbert_S.shtml">Stephen Egbert</a>.(<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/21/employing-geospatial-genealogy-to-reveal-residential-and-kinship-patterns-in-a-pre-holocaust-ukrainian-village/"> abstract </a>): this paper showed how it is possible to visualize residential and kinship patterns in the mixed-ethnic settlements of pre-Holocaust Eastern Europe by using geographic information systems (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a>), and how these results can provide useful materials for humanists to base their work on.
<li><strong>Prosopography and Computer Ontologies: towards a formal representation of the ‘factoid’ model by means of CIDOC-CRM</strong>, by <a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/">me</a> and John Bradley (<a href="http://kansas2011.thatcamp.org/07/21/prosopography-and-computer-ontologies-towards-a-formal-representation-of-the-%e2%80%98factoid%e2%80%99-model-by-means-of-cidoc-crm/"> abstract </a>): this is the paper I presented (shameless self plug, I know). It&#8217;s about the evolution of structured prosopography (= the &#8216;study of people&#8217; in history) from a mostly single-application and database-oriented scenario towards a more interoperable and linked-data one. In particular, I talked about the recent efforts for representing the notion of &#8216;factoids&#8217; (a conceptual model normally used in our prosopographies) using the ontological language provided by <a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2010/08/30/kr-workshop-2-introducing-cidoc-crm-and-frbr-oo/">CIDOC-CRM</a> (a computational ontology commonly used in the museum community).</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I went to Stanford for the <a href="https://dh2011.stanford.edu/">Digital Humanities 2011</a> international conference. This is arguably the most important event for researchers and academics who employ digital methods to tackle questions and problems normally associated to &#8216;humanities&#8217; disciplines. In this blog post I will start by summarising the things I was invited to talk about; then in the near future I&#8217;ll try to integrate this article with other reflections and pointers to interesting materials I ran into at the conference.</p>
<p>I had two papers, one by myself and one with <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/students/romanello/index.aspx">Matteo Romanello</a>, a bright PhD student at <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx">DDH</a> whom I&#8217;m co-supervising (well sort of.. since the college hasn&#8217;t formally recognized me in that role yet). </p>
<p>The first paper is about DJFacet, a <strong>faceted search engine</strong> I created and <a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2011/06/09/djfacet-a-django-faceted-browser/">already discussed elsewhere</a>, so I won&#8217;t bore you with the technical details here. The aspect of it I discussed at the conference deals with the specific employment of DJFacet with <strong>complex humanities databases</strong>. </p>
<p>DJFacet lets you easily build a search interface consisting of many entry point (facets); in particular, thanks to the availability of an advanced functionality called &#8216;<strong>pivoting</strong>&#8216; it is possible to switch the main perspective of a search dynamically (that is, the main result type you&#8217;re searching for) while still keeping the search parameters previously chosen. This means for example that when searching for &#8216;people&#8217; using facets such as &#8216;surname&#8217; or &#8216;age&#8217;, you could change the result type to &#8216;documents&#8217; and keep using the same &#8216;surname&#8217; or &#8216;age&#8217; facets. This is made possible by the implicit connection existing in the database between, for example,  the objects of type &#8216;people&#8217; and the objects of type &#8216;document&#8217; (eg, &#8216;authors of&#8217;). </p>
<p>However, despite the fact that this approach proved to be, from the logical and computational point of view, completely feasible, it also <strong>opened up a number of research questions</strong> from the point of view of the <strong>meaning</strong> of these multifaceted <strong>searches</strong> across different results types. In other words, we realized that often the accumulation of filters ontologically distant from each other could be <strong>hardly translated by the end user</strong> into real-world questions; analogously, the opposite may happen, in so far as simple type of searches may be impeded by the highly structured architecture of a faceted browser. The paper attempted to address these problems and provide some initial solutions to them. Here&#8217;re the slides:</p>
<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_8587975"> <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mpasin/dh11-browsing-highly-interconnected-humanities-databases-through-multiresult-faceted-browsers" title="DH11: Browsing Highly Interconnected Humanities Databases Through Multi-Result Faceted Browsers" target="_blank">DH11: Browsing Highly Interconnected Humanities Databases Through Multi-Result Faceted Browsers</a></strong> <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8587975?rel=0" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second paper (headlined by Matteo) is about HuCit (available at <a href="">www.purl.com/net/hucit</a>), a <strong>formal ontology</strong> we&#8217;re developing together that is aimed at the formal representation of <strong>humanities citation structures</strong>. </p>
<p>The key idea here derives from the fact that while in the sciences a citation is normally represented in the form of a <em>relation</em> between two publications (and often that&#8217;s all is needed eg to generate all sorts of interesting citation network analysis algorithms), in the humanities (and especially in classics) citations are normally analyzed by scholars with a much higher attention to details. </p>
<p>For example, citations may exhibit a particular style which scholars want to study and classify (for example when faced with ancient citations) to the purpose of better understanding and contextualizing the meaning of a citation. Secondly, in classics we have interesting &#8216;phenomena&#8217; like <strong>canonical citations</strong>: these are citations that do not point at any publication in particular, but at an <em>idealized</em> version of a classic text (eg Homer&#8217;s Iliad) which is used as a reference systems for all subsequent editions of that text. Canonical citations fundamentally act as a reference to a point in a (textual) coordinate system which is agreed upon by the scholarly community &#8211; and thus needs to be followed so to facilitate discussion in that community. So, in a nutshell, the HuCit ontology is providing the representational primitives needed to support computational reasoning about the &#8216;humanistic&#8217; way of working with citations. Here&#8217;re the slides of the talk: </p>
<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_8597680"> <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mpasin/an-ontological-view-of-canonical-citations-8597680" title="An Ontological View of Canonical Citations" target="_blank">An Ontological View of Canonical Citations</a></strong> <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8597680?rel=0" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, I had a really good time at the conference. The campus and weather in Stanford are just amazing; the DH community really down to earth and approachable. I&#8217;ll try to update this post in the next weeks, with more information about people and projects that stimulated my imagination. Stay tuned!</p>
