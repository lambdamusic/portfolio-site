								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ran into this resource by chance, it&#8217;s a complete <a href="http://cnx.org/content/col10214/latest/">tutorial on musical analysis</a> by <a href="http://cnx.org/member_profile/abrandt">Anthony Brandt</a> and <a href="http://cnx.org/member_profile/rwmcclure">Robert McClure</a>. It&#8217;s being made available by <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a>, a &#8220;place to view and share educational material made of small knowledge chunks called modules that can be organized as courses, books, reports, etc.&#8221;, where anyone may view or contribute:</p>
<p>The summary says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sound Reasoning” is a web-based, introductory music appreciation course. It offers a new approach to music appreciation for adults, focusing on style-independent concepts. While the course concentrates primarily on Western classical and modern music, the concepts that are introduced apply to music of any style or era. The goal of “Sound Reasoning” is to equip you with questions that you may ask of any piece of music, thereby creating a richer and more comprehensive understanding of music both familiar and unfamiliar. Here are some additional features of the course. 1) ”Sound Reasoning” is completely listening based. No ability to read music is required. 2) The course assumes little or no musical background. A minimum of terminology is invoked. 3) Musical examples are interpolated directly into the text. 4) The course is interactive. A “listening gallery” with exercises follows each module, so that you may practice and refine your listening skills. 5) The modules may be studied in sequence or individually. 6)You may easily print a .pdf of any module.. “Sound Reasoning” is designed as both a stand-alone, self-paced course as well as a supplement to existing university classes. Thanks to Connexions, “Sound Reasoning” is available free of charge twenty-four hours a day in a cross-platform format. [&#8230;] You must have the latest version of Macromedia&#8217;s free Flash plugin to play the musical examples. The course works best using Internet Explorer 6 on Microsoft Windows, or Mozilla on any platform.</p></blockquote>
