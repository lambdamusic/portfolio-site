								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I havent written much in the last days &#8211; been busy writing a new browser for kmi&#8217;s semantic web services team, and moving on my phd thesis during the rest of the time. PLus &#8211; i did some research about ruby,which looks very lisp-alike BUT is web oriented. </p>
<p>Anyways &#8211; that&#8217;s how I run into this pearl of wisdom (<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html">original here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>#7 &#8211; PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ARE LIKE GIRLFRIENDS: THE NEW ONE IS BETTER BECAUSE *YOU* ARE BETTER<br />
Rails was an amazing teacher. I loved it’s “do exactly as I say” paint-by-numbers framework that taught me some great guidelines.<br />
I love Ruby for making me really understand OOP. God, Ruby is so beautiful. I love you, Ruby.<br />
But the main reason that any programmer learning any new language thinks the new language is SO much better than the old one is because he’s a better programmer now! You look back at your old ugly PHP code, compared to your new beautiful Ruby code, and think, “God that PHP is ugly!” But don’t forget you wrote that PHP years ago and are unfairly discriminating against it now.<br />
It’s not the language (entirely). It’s you, dude. You’re better now. Give yourself some credit.</p></blockquote>
