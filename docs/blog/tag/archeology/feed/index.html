								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I went to the <a href="http://caaconference.org/">CAA 2012</a> conference in Southampton, one of the top conferences in the world in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_archaeology">computational archaeology</a>. I couldn&#8217;t stay for longer than a day, but I&#8217;ve seen enough to say that archaeologist definitely know their way around when it comes to combining IT with their discipline. </p>
<p>I presented a poster about the <a href="http://www.artofmaking.ac.uk/">Art of Making project</a> (which deals with categorising and making available online a collection of images of ancient Roman sculpture). In particular I was there for the <strong>Data Modelling and Sharing</strong> session: the formal ontology we&#8217;re working on in the Art of Making (and the accompanying dataset) is likely going to become one of the first in its kind. So I was quite interested in finding out who&#8217;s doing what, when it comes to sharing data about the the ancient world. </p>
<p>The answer is, there are a lot of people doing very interesting things (btw please get in touch if you know of other relatable datasets). Here&#8217;re a brief report on some the papers that struck me (for the full list of the talks I would have liked to attend, check out <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/mpasin">my interactive schedule</a>.)</p>
<li>A <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/b8dba5f531a7d2c41faebf303865357e">paper on the Pelagios project</a> by Leif Isaksen. Pelagios is a consortium that <strong>brings together</strong> an impressive number of other <strong>datasets</strong> on the ancient world. I&#8217;d say each of them is worth taking a look at: <a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/">Arachne</a>; <a href="http://explore.clarosnet.org/XDB/ASP/clarosHome/">CLAROS</a>; <a href="http://www.fastionline.org/">Fasti Online</a>; <a href="http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/">Google Ancient Places</a>; <a href="http://nomisma.org/">Nomisma</a>; <a href="http://opencontext.org/">Open Context</a>; <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">Perseus</a>; <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>; <a href="http://ptolemymachine.appspot.com/">Ptolemy Machine</a>, <a href="http://spqr.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/">SPQR</a>; <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/Ure/index.php">Ure museum</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/5cbf48abc47a735213ea2f95e5b55fce">paper titled &#8220;When, What, Where, How and Who?&#8221;</a> by Sarah May. She reported about a <strong>user-study aimed at understanding how archeologist search for information online</strong>, and whether an more integrated web of data would match their current information seeking behaviours. </li>
<li>The paper &#8220;<a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/efe75fbdd784b8c73d0938e4591af1b0">Exploring Semantic Web-based research questions for the spatio-temporal relationships at Çatalhöyük</a>&#8220;, by <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/research/research-students/holly-wright/">Holly Wright</a>. She presented an archeological data-modeling scenario that calls for <strong>more powerful knowledge representation approaches to time and events</strong>. There are two broad approaches to solve this problem, she said: <strong>temporal reification</strong> (apparently this is mostly done using SWRL rules, e.g. <a href="http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/events/swap2010/paper-04.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCoQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbmir.stanford.edu%2Ffile_asset%2Findex.php%2F1534%2FBMIR-2010-1414.pdf&#038;ei=9BZzT7WaFYfB0QWvn9T5Dw&#038;usg=AFQjCNFwmhf_HaJxEQMq1lI-hl-B8YpSww">here</a>) and <strong>temporal fluents</strong> (some info <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?ix=sea&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=temporal+fluents">here</a>, and also in the context of the <a href="http://www.defeasible.org/ruleml2011ijcai/files/Batsakis.pdf">SOWL</a> project). I don&#8217;t know much on this topic, but surely this paper got me interested in it!</li>
<li>A paper presenting the <a href="http://caaconference2012.sched.org/event/394231b4c4a4ad537ce3cf314e983fb2">SAWS</a> project, which looks at defining and <strong>linking related units of text in original manuscripts</strong> using semantic web technologies.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://data.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/page/">Archeology Data Services</a>, a York-based organisation that aims at &#8216;<strong>preserving digital data in the long term</strong>, and by promoting and disseminating a broad range of data in archaeology&#8217;. In particular one of their project, <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/research/stellar/">Stellar</a>, has produced a <a href="http://hypermedia.research.glam.ac.uk/resources/STELLAR-applications/">number of software tools</a> that facilitate the manipulation of archeological data and their transformation into rdf-compliant formats.    </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, this is the schedule for the whole conference (notice the slick widget &#8211; it&#8217;s powered by a new service <a href="http://sched.org/">sched.org</a>)  :</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.romanportnetworks.org/index.html">Roman Port Networks Project</a> is a collaboration between 30 European partners, <strong>examining the connections between Roman ports across the Mediterranean</strong>. The project has received financial support from the British Academy (<a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk:80/institutes/index.cfm">BASIS</a>) and the University of Southampton (School of Humanities, Department of Archaeology and School of Electronics and Computing Science).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-1.png" alt="Picture 1" title="Picture 1" width="464" height="151" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-227" srcset="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-1.png 464w, http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/picture-1-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></p>
<p>From the website (the bold font is mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The project will use an innovative new approach to data management in order to bring together the many separate sources of information that we have about ports in the Roman Mediterranean. The <strong>Semantic Web is a way of linking data by storing it as statements rather than in tables</strong>. Because the statements are composed of the same URIs that you use in the address bar of an internet browser, they can be accessed by other computers so <strong>different datasets can be connected together more easily</strong>. It also means that we can see all the information related to a given concept, whether it&#8217;s a thing, a property or a class of objects. [some interesting papers about this approach <a href="http://leifuss.wordpress.com/publications/">can be found here</a>]</p>
<p>We hope that by using this methodology we might soon be able to ask questions such as &#8216;where are all the known finds of Dressel 20 amphorae on the Mediterranean coast?&#8217;, or &#8216;which other towns have used the same types of marble as those employed in Tarragona?&#8217; <strong>It is with this kind of knowledge that we can start building theoretical networks of trade and mobility.</strong></p></blockquote>
