								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/eventrecords/millar.aspx">New Directions in the Digital Humanities</a> series this week we had a very inspiring presentation from Dr <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/spark/Researcher.aspx?researcherid=2177048">Paul Millar</a>, Associate Professor and Head of the Department of English, Cinema and Digital Humanities, the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/">University of Canterbury</a> (NZ). The talk focused on the <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/">CEISMIC project</a>, with which Millar and his <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/programme-team">team</a> intended to &#8216;crowdsource&#8217; a digital resource to preserve the record of the earthquakes’ impacts, document the long-term process of recovery, and discover virtual solutions to issues of profound heritage loss. <small>(p.s.: this entry was cross posted on the <a href="http://wip.cch.kcl.ac.uk/2012/05/24/seminar-the-role-of-digital-humanities-in-a-natural-disaster/">DhWip blog</a>)</small></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/"><img src="http://wip.cch.kcl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-24-at-15.11.40.png" alt="Screen Shot 2012 05 24 at 15 11 40" border="0" width="400" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>In the months since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit New Zealand’s Canterbury province in September 2010, the region has experience <a href="http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/recent_quakes.html">over ten thousand aftershocks</a>, 430 above magnitude 4.0. The most devastating aftershock, a 6.2 earthquake under the centre of <a href="http://www.christchurchquakemap.co.nz/">Christchurch</a> on 22 February 2011, had one of the highest peak ground acceleration rates ever recorded. This event claimed 185 lives, damaged 80% of the central city beyond repair, and forced the abandonment of 6,000 homes. It was the third costliest insurance event in history.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZE7p2m4aaNM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As part of the project, a number of inspiring community-oriented digital resources have been made available, including: </p>
<li><strong>Quakestories</strong> <a href="http://www.quakestories.govt.nz/">http://www.quakestories.govt.nz/</a>: it allows anyone to share stories and photos of the Canterbury earthquakes.. e.g. &#8220;<em>Shelves were crashing to the ground and books spewing everywhere. Everyone was bent over <a href="http://www.quakestories.govt.nz/559/story/">and..</a> </em>&#8220;</li>
<li><strong>Quakestudies</strong> <a href="https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/">https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/</a>: a digital archive, built to store all types of content related to the Canterbury earthquakes. It has been developed with companies, government organisations, websites and individuals, to help them to preserve their content. The resource will be made available in the coming weeks..</li>
<li><strong>Whenmyhomehook</strong> <a href="http://whenmyhomeshook.co.nz/">http://whenmyhomeshook.co.nz/</a>: a website dedicated to helping Canterbury School children overcome the recent earthquake by providing a plaform where they can openly share their personal earthquake stories.</li>
<p>In particular, <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/quakestudies">Quakestudies</a> is going to become a massive <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/faqs#faq1">federated archive</a>, containing content sourced from the research community and peak agencies involved with the earthquakes. All of this information will be &#8220;looked after in perpetuity and be available to approved researchers either now or in future years&#8221;. As it is being indexed using a number of approaches (including semantic web technologies too, says Millard) it&#8217;ll make available a number of exploratory pathways into these materials &#8211; many of them it is not possible to foresee. </p>
<p>This is certainly an inspiring example of the employment of digital technologies to support a large number of people; in particular, it is remarkable how the entire initiative was promoted and coordinated by a team of dedicated people at the University of Canterbury that has managed to become a key reference point for the community in such a difficult time.</p>
<p>From DDH, we certainly want to send our best wishes to the project, and we&#8217;re looking forward to using Quakestudies!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A colleague mentioned the existence of <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> to me &#8211; a new and free reference manager. I&#8217;ve stuck with <a href="http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> for a while and was really really happy with it, but I have to admit that Mendeley seems to have quite a few cool features there.</p>
<p>For example:<br />
1) it&#8217;s <strong>free</strong> (and hopefully it&#8217;ll remain like that forever)<br />
2) it provides an <strong>online counterpart</strong>, so that you can check/manage your reference library online too<br />
3) it&#8217;s a <strong>social application</strong> &#8211; it aims at building up a community of researchers/users based on the categorization of one of their primary interests: papers<br />
4) it can be used by researchers as a &#8216;<strong>research homepage&#8217;</strong> which features quite a lot about their academic profile..</p>
<p>Conclusion: definitely worth a try!</p>
