								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No double meaning here &#8211; i just love getting on a train and finding myself in new places and situations all of a sudden. Rediscovering life. So i just got back from canada, kcap (i&#8217;m gonna write something about it soon) and i was trying to plan a trip with my brother for the next xmas break. Well &#8211; let&#8217;s use the web  &#8211; i thought, as he&#8217;s not physically around. So i checked out the available services, and to my surprise the best one is <a href="http://uk.travel.yahoo.com/trip-planner">yahoo-trip-planner</a> !</p>
<p>Why? Well, simple and efficient, not too many ads popping up, and great support for collaborative editing (isnt that supposed to be one of the main requisites?).</p>
<p>The other candidates (not many really) were <a href="http://realtravel.com/member-m509120-tom.html">Tom Gruber&#8217;s RealTravel.com</a>, which I&#8217;m sure has many features (such as travel guides mysteriously popping out, and the like) but also LOTS of ads. How can I plan a trip, if at every webpage I&#8217;m suggested what to do, where to stay and so on? the fun part of planning it is, i think, the exploration&#8230;  realtravel.com instead made me think that I was exploring all the possible ways gruber could make money out of it :-) So i decided, not what i want!</p>
<p>The only other resource I found quite useful and straighforward in planning a trip, was google maps &#8211; however the great missing feature here is the collaborative bit &#8211; I want other people to edit the map damn it! <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-How-Do-I/browse_thread/thread/6d26707560658fc8">..still an open issue instead&#8230;</a>
