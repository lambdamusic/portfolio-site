					<description><![CDATA[@ ivan: yeah colors and animations would definitely improve it (as long as the price remains so accessible!). ps glad you like the theme!

@ ramzez: well as I said I&#039;ve been reading several pdfs on the kindle; you&#039;ve got to struggle a little to find the right orientation and size settings but in most cases the end results was acceptable to me. Some pdf take forever to load though, and that&#039;s quite annoying. I&#039;m not sure how much this can be improved however.. cause it seems to me that a lot of it is determined by the kindle size, and not by the software handling the pdf format (which is notoriously difficult to handle!). Thanks for the comment though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is insightful.
I agree with your points, but there is one big problem with the &quot;current&quot; Kindle (and other similar ebook readers) for me: the screen.
I know that it&#039;s &quot;that way&quot; (&quot;digital ink&quot; is the common name, I recall), to save battery and to be super light. But I don&#039;t like this technology. I need:
- colors
- decently fast animations

That&#039;s why I&#039;m on hold: I&#039;m waiting for a breakthrough.
And I think the Qualcomm Mirasol (http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/) will be that breakthrough.

I really wish Apple decides to embrace it and make a product with it, but if not, I&#039;m confident either Amazon or Sony will use it to make the next generation of their eBook readers.
And that&#039;s what I&#039;ll go for.

Currently, I read on my iPhone, and even if Sun is it&#039;s archenemy, is &quot;good enough&quot;.

Will join you later ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well...nice review! I was kinda impressed by the Kindle as a reading device...It does the job, and it does it very well. I heard there is a search feature which searches across all the PDFs you have got in your Kindle...amazing! Let&#039;s say I have 10 PHP books and I need to know what the flock() function does...instead of manually search in all of them I just need to type &quot;flock&quot; and it gives me all the related material on a single page????? Is it right?????

Anyway, the best feature is the matte screen...I hate glossy screens when it comes to read something in the light..It gives me a headache ;)]]></description>
