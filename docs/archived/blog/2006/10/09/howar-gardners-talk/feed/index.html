					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading your reflections on Gardner&#039;s work.  I am also in agreement with Wikepedia.  Gardner has not expanded on the conceptualization of intelligence.  I would argue that he has made educators acknowledge that there is more to SMART than book sense.

May I borrow the image you have dipicting the intelligences?  It is an effective illustration.  I am giving a talk and it relates well to Differentiated Instruction.]]></description>
