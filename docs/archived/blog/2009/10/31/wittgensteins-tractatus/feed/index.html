					<description><![CDATA[Dear Wu, thanks a lot for your comments. I can see the errors and will try to find some time to fix them asap!! That visualization of the Tractatus was just a little experiment I did while working on PhiloSURFical [http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/] which featured all three translations of the text; in extracting the sentences I must have mixed them up too.. real sorry about that. 
By the way thanks for the links you pointed out, very nice stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Pasin, 

I am writing to you to give a feedback about the original text used in this work of TLP. 

As you have mentioned, the work is based on the Project Gutenberg version. I guess that Project Gutenberg used the Pears &#038; McGuinness translation when you were doing the work, but now it changed to the Ogden translation (http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5740). And as far as I have checked, most of text in the work is from Pears &#038; McGuinness translation, but a few, in the missing, mistaken, and wrongly indented parts (http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/tractatus/info-gutenberg.html), from Ogden translation. They are Proposition 2.1513, 2.202, 2.203, 3.22, 3.25, 3.251, 3.26, 4.12, 4.27. And there might be more in the rest of the text. 

I would very much appreciate it if you could check the text with Pears &#038; McGuinness translation and change the original text link. And thanks a lot for the brilliant work you have already done! 

PS: Get a nice German, and Ogden and Pears &#038; McGuinness translations Side-by-Side-by-Side version of TLP here, http://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/

Sincerely
Wu]]></description>
