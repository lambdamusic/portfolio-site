					<description><![CDATA[Well I found some info: this &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitool.com/pipermail/info-mcl_digitool.com/2005-January/000225.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; interesting link &lt;/a&gt; presents a similar issue with MCL. 
The problem is the mac-file-format. As explained:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#039;d guess it could be because of the problem with different line
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; endings. You could open the file and convert it from CR line endings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to LF line endings with ctrl-X ctrl-F.

So what I&#039;ve done is opening and saving all the asdf-install&#039;ed libraries in my library-folder (~/.asdf-install-dir/....) with Microsoft Word. That&#039;s why we have WORD in our HD.. well jokin&#039; :-)

I thought about having separate libraries for mcl and LW, but it doesnt seem feasible, as the .asdf-install file (which configures where the dwnloaded libraries will go) is customizable, but unique. Unless you want to start moving it around... but it doesnt seem very practical ....

Once all the installed libraries (.asd and .lisp files) have been converted to the mac format, I just copied the aliases to the MCL-asdf registry folder (which can be anywhere). That&#039;s actually what asdf looks up when you load a library!

WARNING:
Preferably, I guess, it&#039;s good to make sure you don&#039;t re-install what has already been asdf-install&#039;ed through lispworks: since mcl can&#039;t read files which are not &quot;treated&quot; as above, i dont know what&#039;s going to happen. 

Since it&#039;s perfectly fine to asdf-install stuff without caring  whether or not the lisp implementation of choice actually runs it, it&#039;s possible to just install everything through LW, and then use it with other implementations whenever needed!
NEAT! That&#039;s where my knowledge arrives right now...

The sad ending of the story, however, is that what I intended to run, Hunchentoot, doesn&#039;t work on MCL. :-((((((((((((((((
A couple of the libraries (CFFI..) are not ported yet !]]></description>
