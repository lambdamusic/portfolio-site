								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last weeks I had a chance to complete a personal project I&#8217;ve been working on for a while: <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">www.resquotes.com</a>. This is a personal information management site that allows one to collect and organise snippets of text (&#8216;highlights&#8217;) made while reading digitally. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an <strong>alpha</strong> release, still much untested and rough around the edges, so I&#8217;d encourage anyone interested in the topic to play with it and get in touch with questions or feedback or even proposals to collaborate so to make it better.  </p>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-08.48.30.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-08.48.30.png"  alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 06 at 08 48 30" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>These days anyone who&#8217;s <strong>reading</strong> and <strong>studying</strong> as part of their daily routine is probably doing it via some <strong>digital</strong> device too. May that be an e-reader like the Kindle, or just the default pdf viewing software that comes with a mac or pc. Digital reading saves lots of <strong>time</strong>, in many cases, but also makes it very cumbersome to annotate texts and especially <strong>keep track</strong> of these <strong>annotations</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">Resquotes.com</a> comes out of this experience: I needed a way to save and organise the important snippets I read and wanted to be able to get back to, sometime in the future, even if I didn&#8217;t know when. </p>
<p>This is the same spirit (I assume!) that made Chomsky write these words in <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/powersystems/NoamChomsky">one of his latest works</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>..reading a book doesn’t just mean turning the pages. It means thinking about it, identifying parts that you want to go back to, asking how to place it in a broader context, pursuing the ideas. There’s no point in reading a book if you let it pass before your eyes and then forget about it ten minutes later. Reading a book is an intellectual exercise, which stimulates thought, questions, imagination. <br />Noam Chomsky</p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, all the hours spent reading PDF files and Kindle books felt to me not as beneficial as they could have been &#8211; unless I had a way to collect and get back to the quotes that caught my attention in the first place. </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">ResQuotes</a> currently allows to import text snippets, either from the <strong>web</strong> or from your <strong>Kindle</strong>, and use them to create collections of related content via <strong>topics</strong> and <strong>folders</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/navigate2.png" alt="Navigate2" title="navigate2.png" border="0" width="600" height="356" /></p>
<p>A <strong>topic</strong> is like the main gist a quote is about. Topics can (and are supposed to) be reused and provide a basic organising mechanism for the quotes one saves. So, you can have many quotes on the topic of &#8216;science teaching in the 20th century&#8217;, or on &#8216;information architecture&#8217;. </p>
<p>So you can have a Topic page which collects together a bunch of quotes which focus on the same idea or concept. </p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-07-at-5.37.31-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 07 at 5 37 31 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-07 at 5.37.31 PM.png" border="0" width="534" height="600" /></p>
<p>Quotes and topics can be added to the application in two main ways. Either by filling out a web form&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-07-at-5.34.26-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 07 at 5 34 26 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-07 at 5.34.26 PM.png" border="0" width="600" height="358" /></p>
<p>&#8230;or by extracting it directly from your Kindle.</p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-07-at-5.39.59-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 07 at 5 39 59 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-07 at 5.39.59 PM.png" border="0" width="600" height="469" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve imported a bunch to stuff into the system you will be able to search for it or organize it further using collections. </p>
<p>That allows also to automatically create &#8216;topic maps&#8217; based on the relatedness and similarity between quotes and topics. </p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/navigate3.png" alt="Navigate3" title="navigate3.png" border="0" width="600" height="365" /></p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-4.54.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 06 at 4 54 53 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-06 at 4.54.53 PM.png" border="0" width="600" height="359" /></p>
<h3>What&#8217;s next</h3>
<p>Difficult to say what is going to happen next. I&#8217;d like to add more import mechanisms, download options, improvements to the way collections are created. But really, I&#8217;d like to get more feedback from real users!</p>
<p>So please please please &#8211; send  me comments if you have any (by the way, next week I&#8217;ll be in Oxford (UK) giving a demo of the app at the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">Force11 conference in Oxford</a>). </p>
<p>Happy reading with <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">resquotes.com</a>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been very reluctant to buy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> at first, but since I got it I&#8217;ve realized more and more that that was the right decision, and I&#8217;ll tell you why. The other worthy candidate of my hard sweated money was<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad"> Apple&#8217;s iPad</a> &#8211; which at first sight looks much cooler and more versatile. But did I really need all of that cpu power? I already have two macs and an iPhone, so the fanaticism alarm bell kept me from rushing to the Apple-store this time. And here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/New-Amazon-Kindle.jpeg"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/New-Amazon-Kindle.jpeg" alt="New-Amazon-Kindle.jpeg" border="0" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>1. <strong>Reading on the go</strong>: honestly, after sitting down for a while and asking myself WHY ANOTHER GADGET I came to the conclusion that that&#8217;s the main reason for wanting a big iphone (so to say). I have lots of pdf&#8217;s, and spend a lot of time on trains, planes, etc. so having a portable reading device that integrates well with my lifestyle has long been a desire (almost a necessity, I&#8217;d say) for me. Both the Kindle and the iPad support this well enough. So we&#8217;re even here. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Weight</strong>: if you&#8217;re carrying around a mobile reader of some sort, you want it to be as light as possible. Here the kindle just wins: 240 g for the Kindle3 WiFi, vs 680 g for the iPad Wifi (the 3G is 50 grams heavier). In a nutshell: the Kindle is amazingly light !!! </p>
<p>3. <strong>Battery life</strong>: again, do you want a mobile device, or a mobile device + a charger you always have to pack with you + worries about where to recharge its batteries? The Kindle offers 1 month of battery life (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B002LVUWFE/ref=sa_menu_kdp32">officially</a>); more realistically, a bit less I&#8217;m tended to think. I can say I already used it for two weeks, reading several hours every day and browsing the internet too (and apparently it takes a few charge cycles for the battery to reach full capacity). So no worries here. The iPad instead, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5510095/ipad-test-notes-battery-life">10 hours or slightly more</a>&#8230;. Mmmmm&#8230;..</p>
<p>4. <strong>Internet</strong>: both have WiFi, but the iPad offers a much more compelling experience (colors, interaction etc.). However, when it comes to 3G the Kindle offer a formula that was new to me: after the initial purchase, you won&#8217;t spend any money on connectivity. Yes, sounds incredible but true: Amazon pays for Kindle’s 3G wireless connectivity, with <strong>no monthly fees or commitments</strong>. And this is valid in <strong>over 100 countries and territories, </strong>.  This feature was a winner for me: if I&#8217;m on the move, I either want no internet whatsoever (= I&#8217;m trying to stay away from work) in which case the iPhone is more than enough; if not, I&#8217;d probably take my laptop so that I can both surf the web and do a thousand other work-related things too. Kindle&#8217;s 3G support matches well with both situations, so here we go. Kindle won for me here.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Simplicity</strong>: I spend most of my working hours in front of a computer, then often go home and play/do music using a computer, maybe watch a movie in the evening using a computer. Do I really fancy having another computer? Definitely not. Especially because one of the major virtues of computers, that is, the fact that they are &#8216;abstract machines&#8217; that can run a possibly infinite range of softwares, turns into a nightmare-feature when it comes to updating these softwares, fixing settings and dealing with a never ending series of other smaller issues that inevitably come up. Having matured some experience with the iPhone, I know already that the iPad will suck up my time this way too. While instead the Kindle is so simple (just a text reader, really) that maintenance is almost non existing. <em>Ergo</em>, Kindle wins here for me..</p>
<p>5. <strong>Price</strong>: last but definitely not least! It&#8217;s just a hundred pounds for the non-wifi Kindle, and a hundred-forty for the wifi one. iPad starts at 499 right? </p>
<p>In conclusion: I guess that the main constraint for me was the fact that I essentially wanted a reading-device for when I&#8217;m traveling. All the rest is a pleasant extra, but still, just an extra.<br />
The iPad is very attractive, sleek, powerful etc .. it&#8217;s definitely comparable to a laptop if you consider the range of things you can do with it. But if you already have a laptop&#8230;  well you know my answer now!</p>
<p>Hope this can be of some help to other undecided buyers &#8211; cheers!</p>
<p>&#8230;.</p>
