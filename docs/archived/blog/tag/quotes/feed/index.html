								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last weeks I had a chance to complete a personal project I&#8217;ve been working on for a while: <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">www.resquotes.com</a>. This is a personal information management site that allows one to collect and organise snippets of text (&#8216;highlights&#8217;) made while reading digitally. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an <strong>alpha</strong> release, still much untested and rough around the edges, so I&#8217;d encourage anyone interested in the topic to play with it and get in touch with questions or feedback or even proposals to collaborate so to make it better.  </p>
<p><a href="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-08.48.30.png"><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-08.48.30.png"  alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 06 at 08 48 30" border="0" width="600" style="width: 600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; " /></a></p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>These days anyone who&#8217;s <strong>reading</strong> and <strong>studying</strong> as part of their daily routine is probably doing it via some <strong>digital</strong> device too. May that be an e-reader like the Kindle, or just the default pdf viewing software that comes with a mac or pc. Digital reading saves lots of <strong>time</strong>, in many cases, but also makes it very cumbersome to annotate texts and especially <strong>keep track</strong> of these <strong>annotations</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">Resquotes.com</a> comes out of this experience: I needed a way to save and organise the important snippets I read and wanted to be able to get back to, sometime in the future, even if I didn&#8217;t know when. </p>
<p>This is the same spirit (I assume!) that made Chomsky write these words in <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/powersystems/NoamChomsky">one of his latest works</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>..reading a book doesn’t just mean turning the pages. It means thinking about it, identifying parts that you want to go back to, asking how to place it in a broader context, pursuing the ideas. There’s no point in reading a book if you let it pass before your eyes and then forget about it ten minutes later. Reading a book is an intellectual exercise, which stimulates thought, questions, imagination. <br />Noam Chomsky</p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, all the hours spent reading PDF files and Kindle books felt to me not as beneficial as they could have been &#8211; unless I had a way to collect and get back to the quotes that caught my attention in the first place. </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">ResQuotes</a> currently allows to import text snippets, either from the <strong>web</strong> or from your <strong>Kindle</strong>, and use them to create collections of related content via <strong>topics</strong> and <strong>folders</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/navigate2.png" alt="Navigate2" title="navigate2.png" border="0" width="600" height="356" /></p>
<p>A <strong>topic</strong> is like the main gist a quote is about. Topics can (and are supposed to) be reused and provide a basic organising mechanism for the quotes one saves. So, you can have many quotes on the topic of &#8216;science teaching in the 20th century&#8217;, or on &#8216;information architecture&#8217;. </p>
<p>So you can have a Topic page which collects together a bunch of quotes which focus on the same idea or concept. </p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-07-at-5.37.31-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 07 at 5 37 31 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-07 at 5.37.31 PM.png" border="0" width="534" height="600" /></p>
<p>Quotes and topics can be added to the application in two main ways. Either by filling out a web form&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-07-at-5.34.26-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 07 at 5 34 26 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-07 at 5.34.26 PM.png" border="0" width="600" height="358" /></p>
<p>&#8230;or by extracting it directly from your Kindle.</p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-07-at-5.39.59-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 07 at 5 39 59 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-07 at 5.39.59 PM.png" border="0" width="600" height="469" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve imported a bunch to stuff into the system you will be able to search for it or organize it further using collections. </p>
<p>That allows also to automatically create &#8216;topic maps&#8217; based on the relatedness and similarity between quotes and topics. </p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/navigate3.png" alt="Navigate3" title="navigate3.png" border="0" width="600" height="365" /></p>
<p><img src="http://michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-06-at-4.54.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015 01 06 at 4 54 53 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-06 at 4.54.53 PM.png" border="0" width="600" height="359" /></p>
<h3>What&#8217;s next</h3>
<p>Difficult to say what is going to happen next. I&#8217;d like to add more import mechanisms, download options, improvements to the way collections are created. But really, I&#8217;d like to get more feedback from real users!</p>
<p>So please please please &#8211; send  me comments if you have any (by the way, next week I&#8217;ll be in Oxford (UK) giving a demo of the app at the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">Force11 conference in Oxford</a>). </p>
<p>Happy reading with <a href="http://www.resquotes.com/">resquotes.com</a>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gregory Bateson (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields.  In the 1940s he helped extend systems theory/cybernetics to the social/behavioral sciences, and spent the last decade of his life developing a &#8220;meta-science&#8221; of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in various fields of science.</p>
<p>From: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson">Bateson</a>, G., 1978, &#8216;Afterword&#8217;, in J. Brockman (Ed.) About Bateson, London: Wildwood House pp. 244-245</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider for a moment the phrase, the opposite of solipsism. In solipsism, you are ultimately isolated and alone, isolated by the premise &#8220;I make it all up.&#8221; But at the other extreme, the opposite of solipsism, you would cease to exist, becoming nothing but a <strong>metaphoric feather blown by the winds of external &#8220;reality&#8221;</strong>. (But in that region there are no metaphors!) Somewhere between these two is a region where you are partly blown by the winds of reality and partly an artist creating a composite out of the inner and outer events.</p></blockquote>
