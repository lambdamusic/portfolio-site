								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I went to Stanford for the <a href="https://dh2011.stanford.edu/">Digital Humanities 2011</a> international conference. This is arguably the most important event for researchers and academics who employ digital methods to tackle questions and problems normally associated to &#8216;humanities&#8217; disciplines. In this blog post I will start by summarising the things I was invited to talk about; then in the near future I&#8217;ll try to integrate this article with other reflections and pointers to interesting materials I ran into at the conference.</p>
<p>I had two papers, one by myself and one with <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/students/romanello/index.aspx">Matteo Romanello</a>, a bright PhD student at <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx">DDH</a> whom I&#8217;m co-supervising (well sort of.. since the college hasn&#8217;t formally recognized me in that role yet). </p>
<p>The first paper is about DJFacet, a <strong>faceted search engine</strong> I created and <a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2011/06/09/djfacet-a-django-faceted-browser/">already discussed elsewhere</a>, so I won&#8217;t bore you with the technical details here. The aspect of it I discussed at the conference deals with the specific employment of DJFacet with <strong>complex humanities databases</strong>. </p>
<p>DJFacet lets you easily build a search interface consisting of many entry point (facets); in particular, thanks to the availability of an advanced functionality called &#8216;<strong>pivoting</strong>&#8216; it is possible to switch the main perspective of a search dynamically (that is, the main result type you&#8217;re searching for) while still keeping the search parameters previously chosen. This means for example that when searching for &#8216;people&#8217; using facets such as &#8216;surname&#8217; or &#8216;age&#8217;, you could change the result type to &#8216;documents&#8217; and keep using the same &#8216;surname&#8217; or &#8216;age&#8217; facets. This is made possible by the implicit connection existing in the database between, for example,  the objects of type &#8216;people&#8217; and the objects of type &#8216;document&#8217; (eg, &#8216;authors of&#8217;). </p>
<p>However, despite the fact that this approach proved to be, from the logical and computational point of view, completely feasible, it also <strong>opened up a number of research questions</strong> from the point of view of the <strong>meaning</strong> of these multifaceted <strong>searches</strong> across different results types. In other words, we realized that often the accumulation of filters ontologically distant from each other could be <strong>hardly translated by the end user</strong> into real-world questions; analogously, the opposite may happen, in so far as simple type of searches may be impeded by the highly structured architecture of a faceted browser. The paper attempted to address these problems and provide some initial solutions to them. Here&#8217;re the slides:</p>
<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_8587975"> <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mpasin/dh11-browsing-highly-interconnected-humanities-databases-through-multiresult-faceted-browsers" title="DH11: Browsing Highly Interconnected Humanities Databases Through Multi-Result Faceted Browsers" target="_blank">DH11: Browsing Highly Interconnected Humanities Databases Through Multi-Result Faceted Browsers</a></strong> <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8587975?rel=0" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second paper (headlined by Matteo) is about HuCit (available at <a href="">www.purl.com/net/hucit</a>), a <strong>formal ontology</strong> we&#8217;re developing together that is aimed at the formal representation of <strong>humanities citation structures</strong>. </p>
<p>The key idea here derives from the fact that while in the sciences a citation is normally represented in the form of a <em>relation</em> between two publications (and often that&#8217;s all is needed eg to generate all sorts of interesting citation network analysis algorithms), in the humanities (and especially in classics) citations are normally analyzed by scholars with a much higher attention to details. </p>
<p>For example, citations may exhibit a particular style which scholars want to study and classify (for example when faced with ancient citations) to the purpose of better understanding and contextualizing the meaning of a citation. Secondly, in classics we have interesting &#8216;phenomena&#8217; like <strong>canonical citations</strong>: these are citations that do not point at any publication in particular, but at an <em>idealized</em> version of a classic text (eg Homer&#8217;s Iliad) which is used as a reference systems for all subsequent editions of that text. Canonical citations fundamentally act as a reference to a point in a (textual) coordinate system which is agreed upon by the scholarly community &#8211; and thus needs to be followed so to facilitate discussion in that community. So, in a nutshell, the HuCit ontology is providing the representational primitives needed to support computational reasoning about the &#8216;humanistic&#8217; way of working with citations. Here&#8217;re the slides of the talk: </p>
<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_8597680"> <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mpasin/an-ontological-view-of-canonical-citations-8597680" title="An Ontological View of Canonical Citations" target="_blank">An Ontological View of Canonical Citations</a></strong> <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8597680?rel=0" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, I had a really good time at the conference. The campus and weather in Stanford are just amazing; the DH community really down to earth and approachable. I&#8217;ll try to update this post in the next weeks, with more information about people and projects that stimulated my imagination. Stay tuned!</p>
