								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gregory Bateson (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields.  In the 1940s he helped extend systems theory/cybernetics to the social/behavioral sciences, and spent the last decade of his life developing a &#8220;meta-science&#8221; of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in various fields of science.</p>
<p>From: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson">Bateson</a>, G., 1978, &#8216;Afterword&#8217;, in J. Brockman (Ed.) About Bateson, London: Wildwood House pp. 244-245</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider for a moment the phrase, the opposite of solipsism. In solipsism, you are ultimately isolated and alone, isolated by the premise &#8220;I make it all up.&#8221; But at the other extreme, the opposite of solipsism, you would cease to exist, becoming nothing but a <strong>metaphoric feather blown by the winds of external &#8220;reality&#8221;</strong>. (But in that region there are no metaphors!) Somewhere between these two is a region where you are partly blown by the winds of reality and partly an artist creating a composite out of the inner and outer events.</p></blockquote>
