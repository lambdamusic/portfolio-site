								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new interesting <a href="http://www.polimetrica.com/?p=productsMore&#038;iProduct=64&#038;sName=knowledge-technologies-(nick-milton)">book on Knowledge Technologies</a> from Nick Milton is available online. It is meant to be read also by novices so  it&#8217;s deliberately not too technical  or complex. I had a quick look at it this morning, and I think that it is interesting even for who&#8217;s already familiar with all this stuff, cause it gives a nice overall perspective on the field. Never too fanatic about the &#8216;semantic&#8217; promises, sober and realistic when describing the features and advantages of these technologies.</p>
<p>The first excerpt is about the &#8216;ever-changing meaning of ontology&#8217;. The second one instead is a graph depicting the role of ontologies in semantic systems.</p>
<p>And the good news is: <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00012800/">you can get a pdf pre-print for free!</a><br />
<a title="226497672.625202 1.jpg" class="imagelink" href="http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/mikele/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/226497672.625202%201.jpg"> </a></p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract<br />
Several technologies are emerging that provide new ways to capture, store, present and use knowledge. This book is the first to provide a comprehensive introduction to five of the most important of these technologies: Knowledge Engineering, Knowledge Based Engineering, Knowledge Webs, Ontologies and Semantic Webs. For each of these, answers are given to a number of key questions (What is it? How does it operate? How is a system developed? What can it be used for? What tools are available? What are the main issues?). The book is aimed at students, researchers and practitioners interested in Knowledge Management, Artificial Intelligence, Design Engineering and Web Technologies.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Nick worked at the University of Nottingham on the application of AI techniques to knowledge management and on various knowledge acquisition projects to develop expert systems for military applications. In 1999, he joined Epistemics where he worked on numerous knowledge projects and helped establish knowledge management programmes at large organisations in the engineering, technology and legal sectors. He is author of the book &#8220;Knowledge Acquisition in Practice&#8221;, which describes a step-by-step procedure for acquiring and implementing expertise. He maintains strong links with leading research organisations working on knowledge technologies, such as knowledge-based engineering, ontologies and semantic technologies.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s nice when a few people&#8217;s interests happen to converge. You start tackling problems together, and learning as a group. This is what happened KMi recently with the Epistemic Logic interest group. We&#8217;ve decided to start a seminar, trying to make sense of the &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_logic">epistemic logic</a>&#8216; area and possibly draw some useful tips from it.</p>
<p>The seminar&#8217;s title is &#8220;<strong>reasoning about knowledge</strong>&#8216;. <a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/fagin/">Fagin</a> and others, lead authors in the area, define its scope as follows (get the <a href="http://frazer.rice.edu/epit/documents/moshe/moshe-book.pdf">PDF here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>As its title suggests, this book investigates reasoning about knowledge, in particular, reasoning about the knowledge of agents who reason about the world and each otherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s knowledge. This is the type of reasoning one often sees in puzzles or Sherlock Holmes mysteries, where we might have reasoning such as this:<br />
If Alice knew that Bob knew that Charlie was wearing a red shirt, then Alice would have known that Bob would have known that Charlie couldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t have been in the pantry at midnight. But Alice didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know this . . .<br />
As we shall see, this type of reasoning is also important in a surprising number of other contexts. Researchers in a wide variety of disciplines, from philosophy to economics to cryptography, have all found that issues involving agents reasoning about other agentsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> knowledge are of great relevance to them. We attempt to provide here a framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the moment we&#8217;ve just been clarifying our language and the conceptual tools we need to move on to the core issues. But the discussion&#8217;s been really lively, so I guess I&#8217;ll keep posting about this. A <a href="http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/mikele/offsite/ep_logic_seminar/2/meeting2.html">simple map of the recent meeting is online</a> for public consumption :-)</p>
