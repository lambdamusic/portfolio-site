<p>I went to the BBC proms last night, to see <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Nyman">Michael Nyman</a>&#8216;s performance. It&#8217;s been a delightful hour, such <strong>inspiring and intriguing melodies</strong>, really worth it! I really love the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_music">minimalistic</a> ideas crop up all the time, but always with a dense and emotional touch. And the <strong>Royal Albert Hall</strong> is an outstanding venue too..</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michaelnyman.com/info/news/article/nymans-music-honoured-at-bbc-proms-2009">After more than 40 years</a> in the vanguard of British music as a composer, pianist, librettist and musicologist, Michael Nyman has been <strong>honoured with his first BBC Proms concert</strong>.</p>
<p>The concert, part of the 115th Proms season, will take place at the Albert Hall, London on Aug 25 and features the World Premiere of a new piece entitled The Musicologist Scores commissioned by the BBC and music from Draughtman’s Contract, Celan Songs and Memorial with guest soloist Anu Komsi in a programme that will commemorate two key dates in musical history &#8211;  the 350th anniversary of Purcell’s birth and the 250th anniversary of the death of Handel.</p>
<p>Both were key influences on Nyman, who edited scores by the two composers as a PhD student under Thurston Dart in the 1960s [at Kings College!!].</p>
<p>“A BBC Prom is obviously something that any composer hopes will happen one day,’’ Nyman says. ‘‘The concert self-evidently commemorates the two giants of English baroque music. But coincidentally it also celebrates my own relationship with the work of the two composers,’’ Nyman says.</p>
<p>“A concert combining the music I have composed directly their work &#8211; the Purcell-based ‘The Draughtsman’s Contract’ and ‘The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover’  and the Handel-based ‘The Musicologist Scores’ seems entirely appropriate.’‘</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the <strong>list of songs played</strong> last night:<br />
The Draughtsman’s Contract – selection 23’<br />
The Musicologist Scores c20’<br />
BBC commission: world premiere<br />
Six Celan Songs – Blume; Psalm 10’<br />
The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover – Memorial 12’</p>
<p>ANd the lineup:</p>
<p>Anu Komsi soprano<br />
Michael Nyman Band<br />
Michael Nyman director/piano</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dunvagen.com/glassengine/#">IBM Glass Engine</a> enables deep navigation of the <strong>music of <a href="http://www.philipglass.com/">Philip Glass</a></strong>.

<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass"><strong>Philip Morris Glass</strong> (born January 31, 1937) is an American music composer. He is considered one of the most influential composers of the late-20th century<sup class="reference"><span> </span></sup><sup class="reference"></sup><sup class="reference"></sup>and is widely acknowledged as a composer who has brought art music to the public (along with precursors such as Richard Strauss, Kurt Weill and Leonard Bernstein).</a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass"> Although his music is often, though controversially, described as <em>minimalist</em>, he distances himself from this label, describing himself instead as a composer of &#8220;music with repetitive structures.&#8221;<sup class="reference"></sup> Although his early, mature music is minimalist, he has evolved stylistically.<sup class="reference"></sup><sup class="reference"></sup> Currently, he describes himself as a &#8220;Classicist&#8221;, pointing out that he trained in harmony and counterpointFranz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach and <span class="mw-redirect">Wolfgang Mozart</span> with Nadia Boulanger.</a></p></blockquote>
