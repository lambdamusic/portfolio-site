								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been very reluctant to buy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> at first, but since I got it I&#8217;ve realized more and more that that was the right decision, and I&#8217;ll tell you why. The other worthy candidate of my hard sweated money was<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad"> Apple&#8217;s iPad</a> &#8211; which at first sight looks much cooler and more versatile. But did I really need all of that cpu power? I already have two macs and an iPhone, so the fanaticism alarm bell kept me from rushing to the Apple-store this time. And here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/New-Amazon-Kindle.jpeg"><img src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/New-Amazon-Kindle.jpeg" alt="New-Amazon-Kindle.jpeg" border="0" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>1. <strong>Reading on the go</strong>: honestly, after sitting down for a while and asking myself WHY ANOTHER GADGET I came to the conclusion that that&#8217;s the main reason for wanting a big iphone (so to say). I have lots of pdf&#8217;s, and spend a lot of time on trains, planes, etc. so having a portable reading device that integrates well with my lifestyle has long been a desire (almost a necessity, I&#8217;d say) for me. Both the Kindle and the iPad support this well enough. So we&#8217;re even here. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Weight</strong>: if you&#8217;re carrying around a mobile reader of some sort, you want it to be as light as possible. Here the kindle just wins: 240 g for the Kindle3 WiFi, vs 680 g for the iPad Wifi (the 3G is 50 grams heavier). In a nutshell: the Kindle is amazingly light !!! </p>
<p>3. <strong>Battery life</strong>: again, do you want a mobile device, or a mobile device + a charger you always have to pack with you + worries about where to recharge its batteries? The Kindle offers 1 month of battery life (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B002LVUWFE/ref=sa_menu_kdp32">officially</a>); more realistically, a bit less I&#8217;m tended to think. I can say I already used it for two weeks, reading several hours every day and browsing the internet too (and apparently it takes a few charge cycles for the battery to reach full capacity). So no worries here. The iPad instead, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5510095/ipad-test-notes-battery-life">10 hours or slightly more</a>&#8230;. Mmmmm&#8230;..</p>
<p>4. <strong>Internet</strong>: both have WiFi, but the iPad offers a much more compelling experience (colors, interaction etc.). However, when it comes to 3G the Kindle offer a formula that was new to me: after the initial purchase, you won&#8217;t spend any money on connectivity. Yes, sounds incredible but true: Amazon pays for Kindleâ€™s 3G wireless connectivity, with <strong>no monthly fees or commitments</strong>. And this is valid in <strong>over 100 countries and territories, </strong>.  This feature was a winner for me: if I&#8217;m on the move, I either want no internet whatsoever (= I&#8217;m trying to stay away from work) in which case the iPhone is more than enough; if not, I&#8217;d probably take my laptop so that I can both surf the web and do a thousand other work-related things too. Kindle&#8217;s 3G support matches well with both situations, so here we go. Kindle won for me here.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Simplicity</strong>: I spend most of my working hours in front of a computer, then often go home and play/do music using a computer, maybe watch a movie in the evening using a computer. Do I really fancy having another computer? Definitely not. Especially because one of the major virtues of computers, that is, the fact that they are &#8216;abstract machines&#8217; that can run a possibly infinite range of softwares, turns into a nightmare-feature when it comes to updating these softwares, fixing settings and dealing with a never ending series of other smaller issues that inevitably come up. Having matured some experience with the iPhone, I know already that the iPad will suck up my time this way too. While instead the Kindle is so simple (just a text reader, really) that maintenance is almost non existing. <em>Ergo</em>, Kindle wins here for me..</p>
<p>5. <strong>Price</strong>: last but definitely not least! It&#8217;s just a hundred pounds for the non-wifi Kindle, and a hundred-forty for the wifi one. iPad starts at 499 right? </p>
<p>In conclusion: I guess that the main constraint for me was the fact that I essentially wanted a reading-device for when I&#8217;m traveling. All the rest is a pleasant extra, but still, just an extra.<br />
The iPad is very attractive, sleek, powerful etc .. it&#8217;s definitely comparable to a laptop if you consider the range of things you can do with it. But if you already have a laptop&#8230;  well you know my answer now!</p>
<p>Hope this can be of some help to other undecided buyers &#8211; cheers!</p>
<p>&#8230;.</p>
