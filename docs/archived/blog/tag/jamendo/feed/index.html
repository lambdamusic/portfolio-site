								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a> is a new model for artists to promote, publish, and be paid for their music. I&#8217;ve used this new service for a couple of hours only but I already like it a lot… </p>
<p>.. can it be because the <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/8325/">Kryos Project</a> are already in it?</p>
<blockquote><p>On jamendo, the artists distribute their music under Creative Commons licenses. In a nutshell, they allow you to download, remix and share their music freely. It&#8217;s a &#8220;Some rights reserved&#8221; agreement, perfectly suited for the new century.</p>
<p>These new rules allow jamendo to use the powerful new means of digital distribution like Peer-to-Peer networks such as BitTorrent or eMule to legally distribute albums at near-zero cost.</p>
<p>jamendo users can discover and share albums, but also review them or start a discussion on the forums. Albums are democratically rated based on the visitorsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> reviews. If they fancy an artist they can support him by making a donation.<br />
jamendo is the only platform that joins together :<br />
A legal framework protecting the artists (thanks to the Creative Commons licenses).<br />
Free, simple and quick access to the music, for everyone.<br />
The use of the lastest Peer-to-Peer technologies<br />
The possibility of making direct donations to the artists.<br />
An adaptive music recommendation system based on iRATE to help listeners discover new artists based on their tastes and on other criterias such as their location.</p>
