								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The online tool <a href="https://mybinder.org/">mybinder.org</a> allows to turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks with one click.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3333" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-03-at-16.32.28.png?w=536" alt="Screenshot 2019-05-03 at 16.32.28.png" width="458" height="393" /></p>
<p>I played with it a little today and was pretty impressed! A very useful tool e.g. if you have a repository of Jupyter notebooks and want to showcase them to someone with no access to a Jupyter environment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3325" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-03-at-16.17.44.png?w=587" alt="Screenshot 2019-05-03 at 16.17.44.png" width="587" height="453" /></p>
<p>See the official <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">docs</a> for more info.</p>
<p>I was able to run many of the <a href="https://github.com/digital-science/dimensions-api">Dimensions API notebooks</a> with little or no changes (follow <a href="https://hub.mybinder.org/user/digital-science-dimensions-api-y3409gua/tree">this link to try them out</a> yourself). Dependencies can be loaded on the fly, and new files (eg local settings) create just as if you are working within a normal Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>Worth keeping in mind the limitation (from the official <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#user-memory">faq</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>How much memory am I given when using Binder?</strong></h3>
<p>If you or another Binder user clicks on a Binder link, the mybinder.org deployment will run the linked repository. While running, users are guaranteed at least 1GB of RAM, with a maximum of 2GB. This means you will always have 1GB, you may occasionally have between 1 and 2GB, and if you go over 2GB your kernel will be restarted.</p>
<h3>
<strong>How long will my Binder session last?</strong></h3>
<p>Binder is meant for interactive and ephemeral interactive coding, meaning that it is ideally suited for relatively short sessions. Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave your window open, this will be counted as “activity”).</p>
<p>Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session. Beyond that, we cannot guarantee that the session will remain running.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Can I use mybinder.org for a live demo or workshop?</strong></h3>
<p>For sure! We hope the demo gods are with you. Please do make sure you have a backup plan in case there is a problem with mybinder.org during your workshop or demo. Occasionally, service on mybinder.org can be degraded, usually because the server is getting a lot of attention somewhere on the internet, because we are deploying new versions of software, or the team can’t quickly respond to an outage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolutely a big <strong>thank you</strong> to the <a href="https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder">mybinder community</a>!</p>

		<title>Share and browse links with MultiUrl</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MultiURL allows you to combine multiple links into one short link that you can quickly and easily share with your friends, colleagues, on your blog or any other website. It makes the process of sharing multiple links at once so much easier, quicker and safer.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.multiurl.com/site/about">MultiURL</a> a very <strong>useful</strong> service. <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> does something similar, but it&#8217;s much broader in its scope&#8230; sometimes you need to share just a few links with collaborators, and have something like a &#8216;dedicated&#8217; platform available for this. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206" title="Picture 1" src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-12.png" alt="Picture 1" width="573" height="422" srcset="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-12.png 573w, http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-12-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></p>
<p>One neat feature is that from a links-list you automatically get various pages you can send your friends to. For example, a &#8216;multilink <strong>homepage</strong>&#8216; containing a summary of your links:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-204" title="Picture 2" src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-22.png" alt="Picture 2" width="395" height="230" srcset="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-22.png 395w, http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-22-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /></p>
<p>Or a nice webpage with a <strong>header</strong> that lets you jump to any of the links without opening new pages:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205" title="Picture 3" src="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-31.png" alt="Picture 3" width="498" height="225" srcset="http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-31.png 498w, http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-31-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /></p>
<p>Maybe a feature that i missing is the ability for users/collaborators to comment on the links you&#8217;ve shared.. it&#8217;d become a full-fledged links-centered discussion board! (or maybe you can if you sign up? I haven&#8217;t yet &#8211; and in fact that&#8217;s the other cool thing about it &#8211; no need to sign up in order to share links!).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a> is a new model for artists to promote, publish, and be paid for their music. I&#8217;ve used this new service for a couple of hours only but I already like it a lot… </p>
<p>.. can it be because the <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/8325/">Kryos Project</a> are already in it?</p>
<blockquote><p>On jamendo, the artists distribute their music under Creative Commons licenses. In a nutshell, they allow you to download, remix and share their music freely. It&#8217;s a &#8220;Some rights reserved&#8221; agreement, perfectly suited for the new century.</p>
<p>These new rules allow jamendo to use the powerful new means of digital distribution like Peer-to-Peer networks such as BitTorrent or eMule to legally distribute albums at near-zero cost.</p>
<p>jamendo users can discover and share albums, but also review them or start a discussion on the forums. Albums are democratically rated based on the visitorsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> reviews. If they fancy an artist they can support him by making a donation.<br />
jamendo is the only platform that joins together :<br />
A legal framework protecting the artists (thanks to the Creative Commons licenses).<br />
Free, simple and quick access to the music, for everyone.<br />
The use of the lastest Peer-to-Peer technologies<br />
The possibility of making direct donations to the artists.<br />
An adaptive music recommendation system based on iRATE to help listeners discover new artists based on their tastes and on other criterias such as their location.</p>
