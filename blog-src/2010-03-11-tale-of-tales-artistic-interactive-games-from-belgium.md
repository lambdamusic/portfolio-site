> [Tale of Tales](http://tale-of-tales.com/) is a games development studio, founded by Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn in Belgium in 2002 (\*).
> 
> The purpose of [Tale of Tales](http://tale-of-tales.com/) is to create elegant and emotionally rich interactive entertainment. We explicitly want to cater to people who are not enchanted by most contemporary computer games, or who wouldn’t mind more variety in their gameplay experiences. For this purpose, all of our products feature innovative forms of interaction, engaging poetic narratives and simple controls.

I run into these guys pretty much accidentally but I've been conquered straightaway by their work. Probably it's because I share with them some sort of passion for **gloomy**, **mysterious**, **melancholic** and almost **depressed** **atmospheres**, or because **adventure-like** (a la zac-mccraken) **3d** games have always had an effect on me. All of this served with a clear intention to make a **work of art, not just a game**. But anyways - definitely worth checking them out imho. Especially cause they give you various demos of their work for free (for both mac and pc)! Including:
