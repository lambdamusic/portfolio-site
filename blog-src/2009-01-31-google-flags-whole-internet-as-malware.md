Google mysteriously breaks and you can't surf the web anymore; seems like a remote scenario that you'd never take that seriously. And yes, today it did happen \[[techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/31/google-flags-whole-internet-as-malware/) reports on this\].

What an weird feeling - all of a sudden it was like being cut off from some sort of life-feed, or left without electricity in the house... It's scary how used I got to the internet..
