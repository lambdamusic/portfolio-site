I guess this is just part of the huge e-learning revolution happening in our century.. what I'm referring to is that through [ITunesU](http://www.apple.com/education/mobile-learning/) - a sort of [university-centered section of iTunes](http://www.apple.com/education/mobile-learning/) that delivers podcasts/videocasts - you can learn an incredible amount of stuff from the top-teachers in the world. Free of charge, anywhere, anytime.

I listened to the first episode of [CS193: iPhone Application Programming](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php) and it's just amazing. Please check out the [various other things offered at Stanford](http://itunes.stanford.edu/), really high quality material!
