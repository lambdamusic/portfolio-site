iChat is not the only IM client for mac, but it's well integrated with the OS, so I always wanted to throw away msn messenger (which i've been used for longer) and pass all my old contacts to ichat. I found [this blog post](http://allforces.com/2005/05/06/ichat-to-msn-through-jabber/) which was very very useful in describing how to set up a [jabber account](http://www.jabber.org/network/oldnetwork.shtml) which connects to an msn one, and then add the jabber account to the iChat client. Easy!

From the same blog, also an interesting tutorial on [how to tag photos using iPhotos](http://allforces.com/2006/03/07/tagging-iphoto/) (did u know you could do it?)
