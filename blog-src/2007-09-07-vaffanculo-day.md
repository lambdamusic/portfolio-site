You dear reader may not know what that means: it's the ["fuck off" day](http://www.beppegrillo.it/vaffanculoday/) - organized by [Beppe Grillo](http://www.beppegrillo.it/english.php) and other thousands of italians to say stop to the moral decaying of our state.

It's on tomorrow in all the [major italian squares](http://maps.google.it/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=it&t=h&num=200&start=0&om=1&msa=0&msid=105899767908383675040.00043790d3bb18fa8203b&ll=42.114524,11.25&spn=10.053068,20.566406&z=6), and [various world ones](http://maps.google.it/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=it&msa=0&msid=105899767908383675040.0004379666d0ded6037c2&ll=9.449062,-11.601562&spn=148.092962,329.0625&t=h&z=2&om=1). **If I were there, I would definitely join them!** (wanna become a friend of Grillo?
