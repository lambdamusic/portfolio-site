[RDFlib](https://code.google.com/p/rdflib/) is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information.

Installing it is easier than what you might think. I googled it and it seems that several people had problems ([missing components mainly](http://xplus3.net/2009/03/09/how-to-install-rdflib/)) withÂ  this.. but in my case it was easy-beasy (well you need to have [easy-install](http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2009/01/27/python-easyinstall-the-peak-developers-center/)):

```
