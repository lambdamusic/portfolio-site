A new version of [OntoSpy](https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontospy) (1.7.4) is available online. OntoSpy is a lightweight Python library and command line tool for inspecting and visualising vocabularies encoded in the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) family of languages.

This version includes a hugely improved API for creating nice-looking **HTML or Markdown documentation** for an ontology, which takes advantage of frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) and [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

You can take a look at the [examples page](https://lambdamusic.github.io/ontospy-examples/) to see what I'm taking about.

### Coming up next

- More advanced [ontology visualisations](http://www.nature.com/developers/hacks/subjects/d3tree) using d3 or similar javascript libraries;
- A better separation between the core Python library in OntoSpy and the other components. This is partly addressing the fact that the OntoSpy package has grown a bit too much, in particular form the [point of view](https://github.com/lambdamusic/OntoSpy/issues/20) of people who are only interested in using it in order to create their own applications, as opposed (for example) to reusing the built-in visualisations.

Of course, any comments or suggestions are welcome as usual - please use [GitHub](https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontospy/issues). Cheers!
