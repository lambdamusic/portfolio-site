Shameless self-plug: [some time ago](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/mikele/blog/?paged=3) I made an [alternative visualization](http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/tractatus/tabs.html) of Wittgenstein's [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus). No special reason, just because I wanted to do some experimentation with a text I was already working on.

Well today I sort of run into it by change, and I really liked it! Isn't that a good feeling when you realize the things you've done in the past did actually make some sense?
