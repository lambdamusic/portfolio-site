Monday morning, I'm trying to re-structure the knowledge base about wittgenstein according to the re-newed version of the ontology. It's not as much fun as playing guitar, but i gotta do it anyway! But some good news came in too: the project for semanticiz-ing (_my word_) the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) is getting more robust, and it has [its own website now](http://inpho.cogs.indiana.edu/). And it's nice to hear that I'm part of that - wow!

It's hard to find people interested in your _niche_ phd work sometimesÂ  - quite frustrating - but when it happens, it's even more appreciated!
