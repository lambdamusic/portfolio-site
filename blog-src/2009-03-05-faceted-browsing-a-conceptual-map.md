UPDATE 8/6/11: I uploaded an improved version of the map Faceted search (navigation, or browsing) is a technique for accessing a collection of information represented using a faceted classification, allowing users to explore by filtering available information. A faceted classification system allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways, rather than in a single, pre-determined, taxonomic order.

There are quite a few resources freely available on the web that might help you with building a faceted browser; to this purpose (and in conjunction with a research seminar we had at CCH) I've put together a [conceptual map](http://www.xmind.net/share/_embed/magicrebirth/xmind-017372/) that attempts to organize this wealth of information a bit more..
