On November 1st we were invited to present the [Scigraph](http://www.scigraph.com/) project at the [London ODI Summit](http://theodi.org/summit/2016), the annual event organized by the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/) to review and discuss the social and economic impact of open data in both the public and commercial sectors.

> If data infrastructure is as important to our infrastructure as roads, then the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/) is helping to lay the concrete. Join us on 1 November to hear inspiring stories from around the world on how people are innovating with the web of data, with presentations from diverse innovators â€“ from startups to high-profile speakers such as Sir [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) (creator of the World Wide Web), Sir [Nigel Shadbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Shadbolt) (AI expert) and [Martha Lane Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Lane_Fox) (Lastminute.com founder).

Our presentation was part of a a session titled **How to design for open government and enterprise**, which included two speakers from industry (me and [Tharindi Hapuarachchi](http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/tharindi-hapuarachchi) from Thomson Reuters Labs) and two from the public sector ([Clare Moriarty](http://theodi.org/summit/2016/speakers/clare-moriarty) from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and [Jamie Whyte](https://traffordinnovationlab.wordpress.com/author/ciljamie/) from Trafford Council).

Feedback was very positive, in particular the audience seem to have liked the long standing commitment Springer Nature towards making science more open.

Other bits and pieces:- the [open data awards](http://theodi.org/news/open-data-awards-2016-shortlists-announced) from this year include various interesting projects and are worth taking a look at;
- **Tim Berners Lee** hinting at the potential of recent technical advances like [blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) and the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/) project;
- The [ODINE](https://opendataincubator.eu/) (Open Data Incubator Europe) session was very interesting, in fact I've learnt that there's a [search engine for the internet of things](https://thingful.net/) too!
Finally, some more pictures..
