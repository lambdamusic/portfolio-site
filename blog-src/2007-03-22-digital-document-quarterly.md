It's an interesting [web-journal](http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/ddq.htm) written by [Henry Gladney](http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/), which deals with various subjects from document digitalization, encoding, semantics and in general the revolution linked to the digital world.

Extract from the first number's manifesto:

> This first DDQ number suggests why taxpayers should pay attention.
> 
> **Why is digital preservation suddenly urgent?** The U.S. Government recently granted a great deal of money to support it. However, the needed technology and infrastructure are not in place.
> 
> **What kinds of challenge need to be addressed?** The challenges include legal, policy, organizational, managerial, educational, and technical aspects. Although much has been written since, the best analysis is \[[Garrett](http://www.rlg.org/ArchTF/)\]. Perhaps the most difficult challenge is selection of what to save.
> 
> **Among these challenges, what are the technical components?** Only one fundamental problem impeded digital archiving until recentlyâ€”how to preserve information through technology changes. This was recently solved, but the correctness and practicality of the solution are still to be demonstrated. The other challenges are merely engineering and solution deployment issues.
> 
> **What is wrong with the proposed direction of prominent research libraries?** The published proposals focus on how archives should be managed, instead of on whatâ€™s needed to avoid losing documents and needed to make saved documents trustworthy.
> 
> **Why might citizens be concerned?** The Library of Congress is to manage the appropriation mentioned above. However, its ability to manage digital information prudently is called into question by a recent National Academies study.
> 
> Of the several dimensions of digital preservation, DDQ will focus on the technical aspects. We will need several issues to do that justice.
