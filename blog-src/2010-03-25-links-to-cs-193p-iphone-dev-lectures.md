For some reasons the excellent slides and other course materials that used to be available on the [CS 193P iPhone Application Development website](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/) have been removed..

Too bad: download all the 2009 course (including videos) from [here](http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/1954415/2674250/), or check out an exact copy of the site [here](http://e-learning.cs.usm.my/apple/iPhone-Dev-Stanford/).

If you're after the 2010 material, there're plenty of places to find it [here](http://groups.google.com/group/iphone-appdev-auditors/search?group=iphone-appdev-auditors&q=2010&qt_g=Search+this+group)...

_The web is miraculous!_
