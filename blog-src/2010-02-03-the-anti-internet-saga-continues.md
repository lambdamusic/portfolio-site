Now Italy's government is [trying to bog down internet providers by making them responsible for the (supposedly) illicit contents published on the web](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1955569,00.html). In short, a dictatorship-worthy **blackmailing proposal**.

> Some say that Italy's ruling class is just struggling to keep pace with the Internet revolution. "**Italy's political culture is far removed from new technology**," says Luca Conti, 34, a blogger in the coastal city of Senigallia. "They're not even focused yet on how to control the Internet since they haven't even figured out how to use it to their advantage." Case in point: more than 100,000 people attended an anti-Berlusconi rally in Rome last month that was organized on Facebook, but the top opposition politicians snubbed the event. Conti says **the country's leaders — left, right and center — are still focused solely on reaching the public via TV and newspapers. And unlike the Internet, the movers and shakers of the old media are some very familiar faces**.

What can I say? It's disgusting - just spread the word and don't let this people walk on your turf. Knowledge is power.
