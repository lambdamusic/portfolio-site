[Neat little project](http://code.google.com/p/uml-to-django/) that will speed up your data modeling using django: think up an application model, formalize it by drawing a UML diagram using the freely available [ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/), and have it tranlsated into django models automatically.

Just use [uml-to-django](http://code.google.com/p/uml-to-django/) and et-voila': the **application is ready** in django!
