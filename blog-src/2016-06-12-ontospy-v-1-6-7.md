A new and improved version of [OntoSpy](https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontospy) (1.6.7) is available online. OntoSpy is a lightweight Python library and command line tool for inspecting and visualizing vocabularies encoded in the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) family of languages.

This update includes support for **Python 3**, plus various other improvements that make it easier to query semantic web vocabularies using OntoSpy's interactive shell module. To find out more about Ontospy, here are a few good places to start:

- Offical documentation: [http://ontospy.readthedocs.org](http://ontospy.readthedocs.org)
- CheeseShop: [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ontospy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ontospy)
- Github: [https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontospy](https://github.com/lambdamusic/ontospy)

Here's a short video showing a typical sessions with the OntoSpy [repl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop):

### What's new in this release

The main new features of version 1.6.7: 

- added support for Python 3.0 (thanks to a pull request from [https://github.com/T-002](https://github.com/T-002))
- the `import` command: this makes it easier to load models into the local repository. You can import a local RDF file or a web resource via its URI. The repo option allows to select an ontology by listing the one available in a couple of online public repositories; finally the starter-pack option can be used to download automatically a few widely used vocabularies (e.g. FOAF,DC etc..) into the local repository - mostly useful after a fresh installation in order to get started
- the `info` command allows to print more detailed info about entities
- added an incremental search mode based on text patterns e.g. to reduce the options returned by the `ls` command
- calling the `serialize` command at ontology level now serializes the whole graph
- made the caching functionality version-dependent
- added json serialization option (via [rdflib-jsonld](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld))


Install/update Ontospy simply by typing `pip install ontospy -U` in your terminal window (see this [page](http://ontospy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more info).

### What's next

* I'd really like to add more output visualisations e.g. [VivaGraphJS](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS) or one of the [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://philogb.github.io/jit/demos.html).
* Probably even more interesting, I'd like to refactor the code generating visualisations so that it allows people to develop their own via a standard API and then publishing them on GitHub.
* Lastly, more support for instance management: querying and creating instances from any loaded ontology.

Stay tuned for more :-)
