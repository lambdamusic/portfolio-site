DjangoCon returned for its second year in Europe; the first as a wholly community-supported conference. The [conference website](http://djangocon.eu/) contains a lot of info and interesting links (even an [iPhone app](http://m.djangocon.eu/)), but in my opinion the coolest thing is the freely available videos of the conference!
