I've been very happy to help out [Cyrus Harmon debugging his Nuclblog package](http://cyrusharmon.org/blog/display?id=76) to make it work with lispworks too (he developed it using sbcl)... it took a dozen emails to understand each other - but the result was worth it! It's a hunchentoot-based engine that you can easily modify and adapt to your needs....

By the way, a more profane thing: I've always suspected [Edi Weitz](http://weitz.de/) (author of many lisp libraries) had a secret passion for Frank Zappa - but now there's no mystery anymore, since a friend pointed me at one of the main sources for his creations' funny names: [Zappa's works](http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/index.php/Hunchentoot)!
