Spent some time hacking over the weekend. And here's the result: a minimalist [interactive](http://hacks.michelepasin.org/witt/onesentence) version of Wittgenstein's Tractatus.

The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus is a text I've worked with already in the [past](http://www.michelepasin.org/blog/2012/07/08/wittgenstein-and-the-javascript-infovis-toolkit/).

This time I was intrigued by the simple yet super cool [typed.js](http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) javascript library, which simulates animated typing.

After testing it out a bit I realised that this approach allows to focus on the text with more attention that having it all displayed at once.

Since the words appear one at a time, it feels more like a verbal dialogue than reading. As a consequence, also the way the meaning of the text gets perceived changes.

Slower, deeper. Almost like meditating. [Try it out here](http://hacks.michelepasin.org/witt/onesentence).
