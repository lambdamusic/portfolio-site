Here're a couple of reference sheets that can become handy if you're doing any semantic web related work. I've found both of them online, and will add more to this list as they come along.

### N3 Language Cheatsheet

I found this table on this blog post: [http://aabs.wordpress.com/semantic-web/the-n3-cheat-sheet/](http://aabs.wordpress.com/semantic-web/the-n3-cheat-sheet/). Some of the formatting was messed up on the original post, so I cleaned it up a little

### Semantic Web Cheatsheet

Another useful cheat sheet can be found here: [http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/resource/html/id/94/](http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/resource/html/id/94/). The card includes RDF/RDFS/OWL vocabulary, RDF/XML reserved terms, examples and SPARQL semantic web query language reference.
