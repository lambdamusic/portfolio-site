> The works in the Internet Classics Archive come from two major sources, an archive of unformatted electronic texts from the [Eris Project](gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/10/33) at Virginia Tech and the [Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/) from Tufts University. Additional works come from Project Gutenberg and other Internet sites, including James Fieser's [Philosophy Text Collection](http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/philtext.htm), part of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy from the University of Tenessee, Martin. [The Deeds of the Divine Augustus](http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html) was provided by [Thomas Bushnell, BSG](http://web.mit.edu/tb/www/). Except in the case of the works from the Perseus Project, which are provided only as links to that site, all works were processed and reformatted for the archive and are provided directly from this site.

The title says : ["Bringing the wisdom of the classics to the Internet since 1994"](http://classics.mit.edu/). That's right - a very useful resource - but unfortunately the wisdom has still to be navigated with 1994's technologies ;-) See below a screenshot of the amazing [Metaphysics by Aristotle](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.html)!
