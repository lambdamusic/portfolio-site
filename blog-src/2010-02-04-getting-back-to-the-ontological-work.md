I'll be working in Osaka for three months on [ontologizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) a couple of datasets with the help of [Riichiro Mizoguchi](http://www.ei.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/members/miz/). This means that I'll have enough time to revise various notions about ontology engineering during this period. Here's a first and fundamental one, regarding the difference between **ontologies and data models**:

> The difference between ontologies and data models does not lie in the language being used: you can deÔ¨Åne an ontology in a basic ER language (although you will be hampered in what you can say); similarly, you can write a data model with OWL. **Writing something in OWL does not make it an ontology! The key difference is not the language the intended use**. A data model is a model of the information in some restricted well-delimited application domain, whereas an ontology is intended to provide a set of shared concepts for multiple users and applications. To put it simply: **data models live in a relatively small closed world; ontologies are meant for an open, distributed world** (hence their importance for the Web).
