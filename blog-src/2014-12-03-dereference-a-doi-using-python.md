A little python script that allows to pass an article [DOI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) in order to obtain all the metadata related to that article.

The script relies on the handy [crosscite.org API](http://www.crosscite.org/cn/), which is one of the wonderful services provided by [CrossRef](http://www.crossref.org/).
