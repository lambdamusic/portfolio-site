It's not the only semweb repository out there, but for sure it's the more interesting. [The whole wikipedia has been translated into RDF](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/About) and made queryable through [SPARQL](http://esw.w3.org/topic/SparqlImplementations).. lots of potential mashups waiting to be discovered! At the moment i'm looking at integrating the philosophy KB i've created with information from there... but I hope there'll be time to experiment too...
