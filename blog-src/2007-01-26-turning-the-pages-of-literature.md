It's a [new service offered by the British Library](http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ttpbooks.html), consisting on a Shockwave app that lets you flick through the scanned pages of various authors' works. Not particularly exciting from the technology point of view, but quite amazing if you think that you're looking at William Blake's notebook, directly from your home computer...

> Explore Blake's own notebook on our website, using the British Library's award-winning Turning the Pages technology. The notebook includes sketches and poems, including 'The Tyger', one of the most famous of all Blake's lyric poems.
