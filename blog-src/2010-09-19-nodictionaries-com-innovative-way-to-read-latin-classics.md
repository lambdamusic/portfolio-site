[NoDictionaries](http://nodictionaries.com/) is a web app that makes it very easy to look up the meaning of words while reading a latin text. It uses a freely available latin dictionary ([Whitaker's Words](http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm)) and what it does is essentially to **enrich each line of a latin text with the explanations of the words appearing in it**.

Nothing too difficult, you might think. True - but the **clean and simple graphical layout**, coupled with a **quick and responsive interface**, seemed to me the real winner here.

The site, built as a master project by a student of [Tufts uni](http://ase.tufts.edu/classics/) (that's where the [Perseus project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) lives, I believe..), features a pretty big number of [latin texts](http://nodictionaries.com/latin). So if you want to brush up your latin, you definitely won't get bored here.

Very nice work - inspiring and straight to the point! A more extensive review of this app can be found [here](http://bestlatin.blogspot.com/2009/06/nodictionariescom.html) (note: the review is particularly good for latinists).
