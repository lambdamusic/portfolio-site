Just read an [article](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C12FC3D5A0C718DDDA80994DE404482) by John Markoff, in the New York Times. I always like to discover new attempts to introduce and describe the semantic web research to the non-orthodox ...

> The projects aimed at creating Web 3.0 all take advantage of increasingly powerful computers that can quickly and completely scour the Web. â€œI call it the **World Wide Database**,â€ said Nova Spivack, the founder of a start-up firm whose technology detects relationships between nuggets of information by mining the World Wide Web. â€œWe are going from a Web of connected documents to a Web of connected data.â€

> The classic example of the Web 2.0 era is the â€œmash-upâ€ â€” for example, connecting a rental-housing Web site with Google Maps to create a new, more useful service that automatically shows the location of each rental listing. In contrast, the Holy Grail for developers of the semantic Web is to build a system that can give a **reasonable** **and complete response to a simple question** like: â€œIâ€™m looking for a warm place to vacation and I have a budget of $3,000. Oh, and I have an 11-year-old child.â€

> One example that hints at the potential of such systems is [KnowItAll](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/knowitall/), a project by a group of University of Washington faculty members and students that has been **financed by Google**. One sample system created using the technology is Opine, which is designed to extract and aggregate user-posted information from product and review sites. One demonstration project focusing on hotels â€œunderstandsâ€ concepts like room temperature, bed comfort and hotel price, and can distinguish between concepts like â€œgreat,â€ â€œalmost greatâ€ and â€œmostly O.K.â€ to provide useful direct answers. Whereas todayâ€™s travel recommendation sites force people to weed through long lists of comments and observations left by others, the Web. 3.0 system would weigh and rank all of the comments and find, **by cognitive deduction**, just the right hotel for a particular user.
