[Easy Install](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall) is a python module bundled with [setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) that lets you automatically download, build, install, and manage Python packages. That is to say - super easy installation of a [long list of Python modules](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/).

You can [download it from here](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads) .

### Installation on Mac OS:

> 1\. Download the appropriate egg for your version of Python (e.g. setuptools-0.6c9-py2.4.egg). Do NOT rename it. 2. Run it as if it were a shell script, e.g. sh setuptools-0.6c9-py2.4.egg. Setuptools will install itself using the matching version of Python (e.g. python2.4), and will place the easy\_install executable in the default location for installing Python scripts (as determined by the standard distutils configuration files, or by the Python installation).
